<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>The Woman Scorned</span></h3>
</div>
<p>To the village of Carcajou came a young
man in the spring. The last patches of
snow were disappearing from under the protecting
fronds of trees bursting into new leaf.
From the surface of the lakes the heavy ice
had melted and broken, and still lay in shattered
piles on the lee shores. Black-headed
chickadees, a robin or two, and finally swallows
had appeared, following the wedges of
geese returning from the south on their way
to the great weedy shoals of James&rsquo; Bay.</p>
<p>The young man had brought with him a
couple of heavy packs and some tools, but this
did not suffice. He entered McGurn&rsquo;s store,
after hesitating between the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Post and the newer building. A newcomer
he was, and something of a tenderfoot, but he
made no pretence of knowing it all. A gigantic
Swede he addressed gave him valued advice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
and Sophy McGurn, daughter of the
proprietor, joined in, smilingly.</p>
<p>She was a rather striking girl, of fiery locks
and, it was commonly reported, of no less
flaming temper. To Hugo Ennis, however,
she showed the most engaging traits she possessed.
The youth was good-looking, well
built, and his attire showed the merest trifle
of care, such as the men of Carcajou were unused
to bestow upon their garb. The bill
finally made out by Sophia amounted to some
seventy dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come again, always glad to see you,&rdquo;
called the young lady as Hugo marched out,
bearing a part of his purchases.</p>
<p>For a month he disappeared in the wilderness
and finally turned up again, for a few
more purchases. On the next day he left once
more with Stefan, the big Swede, and nothing
of the two was seen again until August, when
they returned very ragged, looking hungry,
their faces burned to a dull brick color, their
limbs lankier and, if anything, stronger than
ever. The two sat on the verandah of the
store and Hugo counted out money his companion
had earned as guide and helper.
When they entered the store Miss Sophia
smiled again, graciously, and nodded a head
adorned with a bit of new ribbon. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
were a few letters waiting for Hugo, which
she handed out, as McGurn&rsquo;s store was also
the local post-office. The young man chatted
with her for some time. It was pleasant to be
among people again, to hear a voice that was
not the gruff speech of Stefan, given out in a
powerful bass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More as two months ve traipse all ofer,&rdquo;
volunteered the latter. &ldquo;Ye-es, Miss Sophy,
ma&rsquo;am, ve vork youst like niggers. Und it&rsquo;s
only ven ve gets back real handy here, by de
pig Falls, dat ve strike someting vhat look
mighty good. Hugo here he build a good
log-shack. He got de claim all fix an&rsquo; vork
on it some to vintertime. Nex spring he say
he get a gang going. Vants me for foreman,
he do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was pleasant news. Hugo would be a
neighbor, for what are a dozen miles or so in
the wilderness? He would be coming back
and forth for provisions, for dynamite, for
anything he needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a fine trip anyway, and saw a lot
of country,&rdquo; declared Hugo, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve get one big canoe upset in country
close in by Gowganda,&rdquo; said Stefan again.
&ldquo;Vidout him Hugo I youst git trowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t anything,&rdquo; exclaimed Hugo,
hastily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It was one tamn pig ting for me, anyvays,&rdquo;
declared Stefan, roaring out with contented
laughter.</p>
<p>Miss Sophy was not greatly pleased when
Hugo civilly declined an invitation to have
dinner with her ma and pa. The young man
was disappointing. He spoke cheerfully and
pleasantly but appeared to take scant notice
of her new ribbon, to pay little heed to her
grey-blue eyes.</p>
<p>After this, once or twice a week, Hugo
would come in again, for important or trifling
purchases. It might be a hundred pounds of
flour or merely a new pipe. He was the only
man in Carcajou who took off his cap to her
when he entered the store, but when she would
have had him lean over the counter and chat
with her he seemed to be just as pleased to
gossip with lumberjacks and mill-men, or
even with Indians who might come in for
tobacco or tea and were reputed to have vast
knowledge of the land to the North. Once
he half promised to come to a barn-dance in
which Scotty Humphrey would play the
fiddle, and she watched for him, eagerly, but
he never turned up, explaining a few days
later that his dog Maigan, an acquisition of a
couple of months before, had gone lame and
that it would have been a shame to leave the
poor old fellow alone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>Sophy met him in the village street and he
actually bowed to her without stopping, as if
there might be more important business in the
world than gossiping with a girl. She began
to feel, after a time, that she actually disliked
him. The station agent, Kid Follansbee, admired
her exceedingly, and had timidly ventured
some words of hopeful flirtation as a
preliminary to more serious proposals. Two
or three other youths of Carcajou only needed
the slightest sign of encouragement, and there
was a conductor of the passenger train who
used to blow kisses at her, once in a while,
from the steps of the Pullman. In spite of all
this Sophy continued to smile and talk softly,
whenever he entered the store, and he would
answer civilly and cheerfully, and ask the
price of lard or enquire for the fish-hooks
that had been ordered from Ottawa. He
would pat the head of the big dog that was
always at his heels, throw a coin on the
counter, slip his change in his pocket and go
out again, as if time had mattered, when, as
she knew perfectly well, he really hadn&rsquo;t
much to do. The poor fellow, she decided,
was really stupid, in spite of his good looks.</p>
<p>The worst of it all was that some folks had
taken notice of her efforts to attract Hugo&rsquo;s
attention. The people of Carcajou were good-natured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
but prone to guffaws. One or two
asked her when the wedding would take
place, and roared at her indignant denials.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Hugo was utterly ignorant
of the feelings that had arisen in Miss
Sophy McGurn&rsquo;s bosom. He worked away
at a great rocky ledge, and loud explosions
were not uncommon at the big falls of Roaring
River. Also he cut a huge pile of firewood
against the coming of winter, and, from
time to time, would take a rod and lure from
the river some of the fine red square-tailed
trout that abounded in its waters. A few
books on mining and geology, and an occasional
magazine, served his needs of mental
recreation. A French Canadian family settled
about a mile north of his shack soon grew
friendly with him. There were children he
was welcomed by, and a batch of dogs that
tried in vain to tear Maigan to pieces, until
with club and fang they were taught better
manners. To the young man&rsquo;s peculiar disposition
such surroundings were entirely satisfactory.
There was a freedom in it, a sense
of personal endeavor, a hope of success, that
tinted his world in gladdening hues.</p>
<p>When autumn came he shouldered his rifle
and went out to the big swampy stretches of
the upper river, where big cow moose and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
their ungainly young, soon to be abandoned,
wallowed in the oozy bottoms of shallow
ponds and lifted their heads from the water,
chewing away at the dripping roots of lily-pads.
There were deer, also, and he caught
sight of one or two big bull-moose but forebore
to shoot, for the antlers were still in velvet
and there was not enough snow on the
ground to sledge the great carcasses home.
He contented himself with a couple of bucks,
which he carried home and divided with his
few neighbors, also bringing some of the meat
to Stefan&rsquo;s wife at Carcajou. Later on he
killed two of the big flathorns, hung the huge
quarters to convenient trees and went back to
Papineau&rsquo;s, the Frenchman&rsquo;s place, for the
loan of his dog-team.</p>
<p>After this came the winter with heavy falls
of snow and cold that sent the tinted alcohol
in the thermometer at the station down very
close to the bulb. Carcajou and its inhabitants
seemed to go to sleep. The village street
was generally deserted. Even the dogs stayed
indoors most of the day, hugging the cast-iron
stoves. At this time all the Indians were away
at their winter hunting grounds, and many of
the lumberjacks had gone further south where
the weather did not prevent honest toil. The
big sawmill was utterly silent and the river,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
wont to race madly beneath the railroad
bridge, had become a jumbled mass of ice and
rock.</p>
<p>The only men who kept up steady work in
and near Carcajou formed the section gang
on the railroad. One day, in the middle of
winter, and in quickly gathering shadows,
Pete Coogan, their foreman, was walking the
track back towards the village and had
reached the big cut whose other end led to
the bridge at Carcajou. The wind bit hard
as it howled through the opening in the hill
and the man walked wearily, pulling away at
a short and extinct pipe and thinking of little
but the comfort that would be his after he
reached his little house and kicked off his
heavy Dutch stockings. A hot and hearty
meal would be ready for him, and after this
he would light another pipe and listen to his
wife&rsquo;s account of the village doings. Since
before daylight he had been toiling hard with
his men, in a place where tons of ice and snow
had thundered down a mountainside and covered
the rails, four or five feet deep. The
work had been hurried, breathless, anxious,
but finally they had been able to remove the
warning signals after clearing the track in
time to let the eastbound freight thunder by,
with a lowing of cold, starved cattle tightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
packed and a squealing of hogs by the legion.
A frost-encased man had waived a thickly-mittened
hand at them from the top of a lumber
car, and the day&rsquo;s work was over, all but
clearing a great blocked culvert, lest an unexpected
thaw or rain might flood the right
of way. To these men it was all in the day&rsquo;s
work and unconscious passengers snored away
in their berths, unknowing of the heroic toil
their safety required.</p>
<p>So Pete walked slowly, his grizzled head
bent against the blast as he struggled between
the metals, listening. At a sudden shrieking
roar he moved deliberately to one side, his
back resting against a bank of snow left by the
giant circular plough whose progress, on the
previous day, had been that of a slow but irresistible
avalanche. A crashing whistle tore
the air and the wind of the rushing train
pulled at his clothes and swirled sharp flakes
into his eyes. Yet he dimly saw something
white flutter down to his feet and he picked it
up. It chanced to be a paper tossed out by
some careless hand, a rather disreputable
sheet printed some thousand miles away, one
of the things that lie like scabs on the outer
hide of civilization. It was much too dark
and cold for him to think of removing a mitten
and searching for the glasses in his coat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
pocket. But the respect is great, in waste
places, for the printed word. There news of
the great outside world trickles in slowly, and
he carefully stuffed the thing between two of
the big horn buttons of his red-striped
mackinaw.</p>
<p>There were but a few minutes more of toil
for him. At last he passed over the bridge, in
a flurry of swirling ice-crystals, and finally
made his way into McGurn&rsquo;s store, which is
across the way from the railway depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold night,&rdquo; he announced, stamping his
feet near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follansbee he says they report fifty below
at White River,&rdquo; a man sitting by the stove
informed him.</p>
<p>Coogan nodded and approached the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a plug, Miss Sophy,&rdquo; he told the
girl who sat at a rough counter, adding figures.
&ldquo;The wind&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; real sharp and I
got the nose most friz off&rsquo;n my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose, with a yawn, and handed him
the tobacco. She swept his ten-cent piece in a
drawer and sat down again. One of the men
lounging about the great white-topped stove
in the middle of the room pointed to Coogan&rsquo;s
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re that careless, Pete,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
&rsquo;low that&rsquo;s a bundle o&rsquo; thousand dollar bills
as is droppin&rsquo; off&rsquo;n yer coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old section foreman looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;d most forgot. This here&rsquo;s some
kind o&rsquo; paper I picked up on the track. Beats
anything how passengers chucks things off.
Mike Smith &rsquo;most got killed last week with
an empty bottle. Lucky he had his big muskrat
cap on. May be ye&rsquo;d like to see it, Miss
Sophy? Guess my old woman wouldn&rsquo;t have
no use for it as it don&rsquo;t seem to have any
picters in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to place it on the counter
when one of the men took it from his hand
and held it under the hanging oil lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he chuckled, somewhat raspingly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what Sophy needs real bad. Ye
wants ter study that real careful, Sophy.
It&rsquo;ll show ye as there&rsquo;s just as good fish in the
sea as was ever took out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl leaned far out over the counter
and snatched the paper away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s just as good fish as that there
Ennis lad,&rdquo; repeated the man.</p>
<p>A single glance had acquainted Sophy with
the title. It was the <i>Matrimonial Journal</i>.
She flung it down to her feet, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get out of here with your Ennis!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t marry
him if he was the last man on earth. I&ndash;&ndash;I
just despise him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s real lucky for ye,&rdquo; snickered
the man. &ldquo;I heard him say&ndash;&ndash;lemme see&ndash;&ndash;yes,
&rsquo;bout three-four days ago, as he wasn&rsquo;t
nowise partial ter carrots. It&rsquo;s a wegetable
as he couldn&rsquo;t never bear the sight of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hand went up to her fine head of
auburn hair and a deep red rose from her
cheeks to its roots. Her narrow lips became a
mere slit in her face and her steely eyes
flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and he&rsquo;s the kind as thinks himself
a gentleman!&rdquo; she hissed out. &ldquo;Get out
o&rsquo; here, all of ye! There ain&rsquo;t a man in Carcajou
as I&rsquo;d wipe my boots on. Clear out o&rsquo;
here, I tell ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men left, Pete silently and disapprovingly,
the other two guffawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe as how that lad Ennis ever
said anything o&rsquo; the kind,&rdquo; declared the foreman.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine bye, he is, and it ain&rsquo;t like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the village joker
assured him. &ldquo;But &rsquo;twas too much of a
chance ter get a rise out er Sophy for me to
lose it. Ain&rsquo;t she the hot-tempered thing?
Just the same she wuz dead sot on gettin&rsquo; him,
we all know that, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s mad clear
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see as yer got any call ter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
rile the gal, just the same,&rdquo; ventured Pete.
&ldquo;Like enough she can&rsquo;t help herself, she can&rsquo;t,
and just because she got a temper like a sorrel
mare ain&rsquo;t no good reason ter be hurtin&rsquo; her
feelin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other two chuckled again and
started towards the big boarding-house, whose
ceilings and walls were beautifully covered
with stamped metal plates guaranteed to last
for ever and sell for old iron afterwards. Its
corrugated iron roof, to most of Carcajou&rsquo;s
population, represented the very last word in
architectural glory.</p>
<p>Within the store Miss Sophy was biting her
nails, excitedly, and felt all the fury of the
woman scorned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>What Happened to a Telegram</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Customers were rare on such terribly cold
nights. For a long time Sophy McGurn
held her chin in the palm of her hand, staring
about her from time to time, without seeing
anything but the visions her anger evolved.
Presently, however, she took up the small bag
of mail and sorted out a few letters and
papers, placing them in the individual boxes.
But while she worked the heightened color of
her face remained and her teeth often closed
upon her lower lip. There was a postal card
addressed to Hugo Ennis. She turned it over,
curiously, but it proved to be an advertisement
of some sort of machinery and she threw it
from her, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s ready, Sophy,&rdquo; cried a shrill
voice. &ldquo;Train&rsquo;s in and father&rsquo;ll be here in a
minute. Get the table fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>For a minute she busied herself putting
down plates and knives and forks. She heard
her father coming in. He had been away on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
some business at the next station. She heard
him kicking off his heavy felt shoes and he
came into the room in his stocking-feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ma! Hello, Sophy! Guess ye&rsquo;ve
been settin&rsquo; too close to the hot stove, ain&rsquo;t ye?
Yer face is red as a beet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My face is all right!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
angrily. &ldquo;Them as don&rsquo;t like it can look the
other way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother, a quiet old soul, looked at her
in silence and dished out the broiled ham and
potatoes. The old gentleman snickered but
forebore to add more fuel to the fire. He was
a prudent man with a keen appreciation of
peace. They sat down. Under a chair the
old cat was playing with her lone kitten, sole
remnant of a large litter. An aggressive clock
with a boldly painted frame was beating
loudly. Beneath the floor the oft-repeated
gnawing of a mouse or rat went on, distractingly.
From the other side of the road, in
spite of double-windows and closed doors,
came the wail of an ill-treated violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over to Carreau&rsquo;s
an&rsquo; smash that fiddle,&rdquo; suddenly asserted
Sophy, truculently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; on
my nerves. Talk o&rsquo; cats screechin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that, Sophy,&rdquo; advised her
mother, patiently. &ldquo;Not but what it&rsquo;s mighty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
tryin&rsquo;, sometimes, for Cyrille he don&rsquo;t ever
get further&rsquo;n them two first bars of &lsquo;The
Campbells are comin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy sniffed and poured herself out strong
tea. She drank two cups of it but her appetite
was evidently poor, for she hardly touched
her food. Her father was engaged in a long
explanation of the misdeeds of a man who
had sold him inferior pork, as she folded her
napkin, slipped it into her ring, and went
back into the store. Here she sat on her stool
again, tapping the counter with closed
knuckles. Her eyes chanced to fall upon the
paper she had thrown down on the floor, and
she picked it up and began to read. Pete
Coogan, when he had brought it into the store,
unknowingly had set big things in motion.
He would have been amazed at the consequences
of his act.</p>
<p>Presently Sophy became deeply interested.
The pages she turned revealed marvelous
things. Even to one of her limited attainments
in the way of education and knowledge
of the world the artificiality of many of the
advertisements was apparent. Others made
her wonder. It was marvelous that there
were so many gentlemen of good breeding
and fine prospects looking hungrily for soul-mates,
and such a host of women, young or, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
a few instances, confessing to the early thirties,
seeking for the man of their dreams, for
the companion who would understand them,
for the being who would bring poetry into
their lives. Some, it is true, hinted at far more
substantial requirements. But these, in the
brief space of a few lines, were but hazily revealed.
Among the men were lawyers needing
but slight help to allow them to reach
wondrous heights of forensic prosperity.
There were merchants utterly bound to
princely achievement. Also there was a
sprinkling of foreign gentlemen suggesting
that they might exchange titles of high nobility
for some little superfluity of wealth. Good
looks were not so essential as a kindly, liberal
disposition, they asserted, and also hinted that
youth in their brides was less important than
the quality of bank accounts. The ladies, as
described by themselves, were tall and handsome,
or small and vivacious. Some esteemed
themselves willowy while others acknowledged
Junoesque forms. But all of them, of
either sex, high or short, thin or stout, appeared
to think only of bestowing undying
love and affection for the pure glory of giving,
for the highest of altruistic motives. Other
and more trivial things were spoken of, as a
rule, in a second short paragraph which, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
the initiated, would have seemed rather more
important than the longer announcements.
At any rate, that which they asked in exchange
for the gifts they were prepared to lavish always
appeared to be quite trivial, at first sight.</p>
<p>Sophy McGurn, as she kept on reading,
was not a little impressed. Yet, gradually, a
certain native shrewdness in her nature began
to assert itself. She had helped her father in
the store for several years and knew that
gaudy labels might cover inferior goods. She
by no means believed all the things she read.
At times she even detected exaggeration, lack
of candor, motives less allowable than the
ones so readily advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess most of them are fakes,&rdquo; she finally
decided, not unwisely. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s some of
them must get terribly fooled. I&ndash;&ndash;I wonder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cogitations were interrupted by a small
boy who entered and asked for a stamped envelope.
A few people, later on, came in to
find out if there was any mail for them. But
during the intervals she kept on poring over
those pages. One by one the lights of Carcajou
were going out. Carreau&rsquo;s fiddle had
stopped whining long before. The cat lay
asleep in the wood-box, near the stove, with
the kitten nestled against her. Old McGurn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
called down to her that it was time for bed,
but the girl made no answer.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a marvelous idea that had come
to her. She saw a dim prospect of revenge.
It was as if the frosted windows had gradually
cleared and let in the light of the stars.
Hugo Ennis had made a laughing-stock of
her. He didn&rsquo;t like carrots, forsooth! She
was only too conscious of the failure of her
efforts to attract him. But he had noticed
them and commented on them to others, evidently.
It was enough to make one wild!</p>
<p>The oil in the swinging lamp had grown
very low and the light dim by the time she
finished a letter, in which she enclosed some
money. Then she stamped it and placed it in
the bag that would be taken up in the morning,
for the eastbound express. Finally she
placed the heavy iron bar against the front
door and went up the creaking stairs to her
room as the loud-ticking clock boomed out
eleven strokes, an unearthly hour for Carcajou.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later a copy of the
<i>Matrimonial Journal</i> was forwarded to
A.B.C., P.O. Box 17, Carcajou, Ontario,
Canada. Miss Sophy McGurn retired with it
to her room, looked nervously out of the window,
lest any one might have observed her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
and searched the pages feverishly. Yes!
There it was! Her own words appeared in
print!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wealthy young man owning a silver mine in Canada
would like to correspond with a young lady who would appreciate
a fine home beside a beautiful river. In exchange
for all that he can bestow upon her he only seeks in the
woman he will marry an affectionate and kindly disposition
suited to his own. Write A.B.C., P.O. Box 17, Carcajou,
Ontario, Can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the next few days it was with unwonted
eagerness that Sophy opened the mail
bags. Finally there came a letter, followed
by five, all in different handwritings and in
the same mail. For another week or ten days
others dribbled in. They were all from different
women, cautiously worded, asking all
manner of questions, venturing upon descriptions
of themselves. Unanimously they proclaimed
themselves bubbling over with affection
and kindliness. The girl was impressed
with the wretched spelling of most of them,
with the evident tone of artificiality, with the
patent fact that the writers were looking for a
bargain. All these letters, even the most
poorly written, gave Sophy the impression
that the correspondents were dangerous
people, she knew not why, and might perhaps
hoist her with her own petard. She studied
them over and over again, with a feeling of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
disappointment, and reluctantly decided that
the game was an unsafe one.</p>
<p>Two days had gone by without a letter to
A.B.C. when at last one turned up. At once it
seemed utterly different, giving an impression
of bashfulness and timidity that contrasted
with the boldness or the caution of the others.
That night, with a hand disguised as best she
could, the girl answered it. She knew that
several days must elapse before she could obtain
a reply and awaited it impatiently. It
was this, in all probabilities, that made her
speak snappishly to people who came to trade
in the store or avail themselves of the post-office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool,&rdquo; she told herself a score of
times. &ldquo;They all want the money to come
here and it must be enough for the return
journey. This last one ain&rsquo;t thought of it,
but she&rsquo;ll ask also, in her next letter, I bet.
And I haven&rsquo;t got it to send; and if I had it I
wouldn&rsquo;t do so. They might pocket it and
never turn up. And anyway I might be getting
in trouble with the postal authorities.
Guess I better not answer when it comes. I&rsquo;ll
have to find some other way of getting square
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time she regretted the dollars spent
from her scant hoard for the advertisement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
but the reply came and the game became a
passionately interesting one. She answered
the letter again, using a wealth of imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll sure answer this one, but then I&rsquo;ll
say I&rsquo;ve changed my mind and have decided
that I ain&rsquo;t going to marry. Takes me really
for a man, she does. Must be a fool, she must.
And she ain&rsquo;t asked for money, ain&rsquo;t that
funny? If she writes back she&rsquo;ll abuse me
like a pickpocket, anyway. Won&rsquo;t he be mad
when he gets the letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy&rsquo;s general knowledge of postal matters
and of some of the more familiar rules of
law warned her that she was skating on thin
ice. Yet her last letter had ventured rather
far. In her first letter she had merely signed
with the initials, but this time she had boldly
used Hugo Ennis&rsquo;s name. She thought she
would escape all danger of having committed
a forgery by simply printing the letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides, there ain&rsquo;t any one can tell I
ever wrote those letters,&rdquo; she reassured herself,
perhaps mistakenly. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s ever
any enquiry I&rsquo;ll stick to it that some one just
dropped them in the mail-box and I forwarded
them as usual. When it comes to her
answers they&rsquo;ll all be in Box 17, unopened,
and I can say I held them till called for, according
to rules. I never referred to them in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
what I wrote. Just told her to come along
and promised her all sorts of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she waited impatiently for an
answer, which never came. Instead of it
there was a telegram addressed to Hugo Ennis,
which was of course received by Follansbee,
the station agent, who read it with eyes
rather widely opened. He transcribed the
message and entrusted it to big Stefan, the
Swede, who now carried mail to a few outlying
camps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing, Stefan,&rdquo; commented
Joe. &ldquo;Looks like there&rsquo;s some woman comin&rsquo;
all the way from New York to see yer friend
Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, dat&rsquo;s yoost his own pusiness, I tank,&rdquo;
answered the Swede, placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, but it&rsquo;s queer, anyways.
Did he ever speak of havin&rsquo; some gal back
east?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had it vould still be his own pusiness,&rdquo;
asserted Stefan, biting off a chew from
a black plug and stowing away the telegram
in a coat pocket. Hugo Ennis was his friend.
Anything that Hugo did was all right. Folks
who had anything to criticize in his conduct
were likely to incur Stefan&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>
<p>The big fellow&rsquo;s dog-team was ready. At
his word they broke the runners out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
snow, barking excitedly, but for the time being
they were only driven across the way to the
post-office for the mail-bag.</p>
<p>Sophy handed the pouch to him, her face
none too agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat all vhat dere is for Toumichouan?&rdquo;
asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; answered the girl, snappily.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a parcel here for Papineau
and a letter for Tom Carew&rsquo;s wife. If you
see any one going by way of Roaring River
tell him to stop there and let &rsquo;em know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can gif &rsquo;em to me, too,&rdquo; said Big
Stefan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; dat vay. I got one of
dem telegraft tings for Hugo Ennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy rushed out from behind the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Stefan, calmly. &ldquo;It is
shut anyvays, de paper is. Follansbee he
youst gif it to me. I tank nobotty open dat
telegraft now till Hugo he get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tucked the mail-bag and the parcel under
one arm and went out, placing the former in
a box that was lashed to the toboggan. Then
he clicked at his dogs, who began to trot off
easily towards the rise of ground at the side
of the big lake. It was a sheet of streaky
white, smooth or hummocky according to
varying effects of wind and falling levels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Far out on its surface he saw two black dots
that were a pair of ravens, walking in dignified
fashion and pecking at some indistinguishable
treasure trove. At the summit of
the rise he clicked again and the dogs went
on faster, the man running behind with the
tireless, flat-footed gait of the trained traveler
of the wilderness.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile old McGurn was busy in
the store and Sophy put on her woollen <i>tuque</i>
and her mitts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to the depot and see about
that box of Dutch socks,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T ain&rsquo;t due yet,&rdquo; observed her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see, anyway,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>In the station she found Joe Follansbee in
his little office. The telegraphic sounder was
clicking away, with queer sudden interruptions,
in the manner that is so mysterious to
the uninitiated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you busy, Joe?&rdquo; she asked him,
graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; answered the young fellow,
grinning pleasantly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the usual
stuff. The 4.19 is two hours late, and I&rsquo;ve
had one whole private message. Gettin&rsquo; to be
a busy place, Carcajou is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s getting messages? Old man Symonds
at the mill?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to guess again. It&rsquo;s a wire all
the way from New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it about, Joe?&rdquo; she asked, in
her very sweetest manner.</p>
<p>Indeed, the inflection of her voice held
something in it that was nearly caressing.
Kid Follansbee had long admired her, but of
late he had been quite hopeless. He had observed
the favor in which Ennis had seemed
to stand before the girl, and had perhaps been
rather jealous. It was pleasant to be spoken
to so agreeably now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t supposed to tell,&rdquo; he informed
her, apologetically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the rules.
Private messages ain&rsquo;t supposed to be told to
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll tell me, Joe, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
asked again, smiling at him.</p>
<p>It was a chance to get even with the man he
deemed his rival and he couldn&rsquo;t very well
throw it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will if ye&rsquo;ll promise not to repeat
it,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
some woman by the name of Madge who&rsquo;s
wired to Ennis she&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when&rsquo;s she due, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just says &lsquo;Leaving New York this evening.
Please have some one to meet me.
Madge Nelson.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For&ndash;&ndash;for the land&rsquo;s sakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned, having suddenly become quite
oblivious of Joe, who was staring at her, and
walked back slowly over the hard-packed
snow that crackled under her feet in the intense
cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she told herself, doggedly.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I guess she&rsquo;ll just tear his eyes
out when she finds out she&rsquo;s been fooled.
She&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; everybody and&ndash;&ndash;and they&rsquo;ll
believe her, of course, and&ndash;&ndash;and like enough
they&rsquo;ll laugh at him, now, instead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this time Stefan rode his light
toboggan when the snow was not too hummocky,
or when the grade favored his bushy-tailed
and long-nosed team. At other times
he broke trail for them or, when the old tote-road
allowed, ran alongside. With all his
fast traveling it took him nearly three hours
to reach the shack that stood on the bank, just
a little way below the great falls of Roaring
River. Here he abandoned the old road that
was so seldom traveled since lumbering operations
had been stopped in that district, owing
to the removal of available pine and spruce.
At a word from him the dogs sat down in
their traces, their wiry coats giving out a thin
vapor, and he went down the path to the log
building. The door was closed and he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
already noted that no film of smoke came from
the stove-pipe. While it was evident that
Ennis was not at home Stefan knocked before
pushing his way in. The place was deserted,
as he had conjectured. Drawing off his mitt
he ascertained that the ashes in the stove were
still warm. There was a rough table of axe-hewn
boards and he placed the envelope on it,
after which he kindled a bit of fire and made
himself a cup of hot tea that comforted him
greatly. After this it took but a minute to
bind on his heavy snowshoes again and he rejoined
his waiting dogs, starting off once more
in the hard frost, his breath steaming and
once more gathering icicles upon his short and
stubby yellow moustache.</p>
<p>It was only in the dusk of the short winter&rsquo;s
day that Hugo Ennis returned to his home,
carrying his gun, with Maigan scampering
before him. It was quite dark within the
shack and he placed the bag that had been on
his shoulders upon the table of rough planks.
After this he drew off his mitts and unfastened
his snowshoes after striking a light and
kindling the oil lamp. Then he pulled a
couple of partridges and a cold-stiffened hare
out of the bag, which he then threw carelessly
in a corner. Whether owing to the dampness
of melting snow or the stickiness of fir-balsam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
on the bottom of the bag, the envelope Stefan
had left for him stuck to it and he never saw
the telegram that had been sent from the far-away
city.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Out of a Wilderness</span></h3>
</div>
<p>A couple of days before Sophy&rsquo;s advertisement
appeared in the <i>Matrimonial
Journal</i> a girl rose from her bed in one of the
female wards of the great hospital on the
banks of the East River, in New York. On
the day before the visiting physician had
stated that she might be discharged. She was
not very strong yet but the hospital needed
every bed badly. Pneumonia and other diseases
were rife that winter.</p>
<p>A kindly nurse carried her little bag for
her down the aisle of the ward and along the
wide corridor till they reached the elevator.
Madge Nelson was not yet very steady on her
feet; once or twice she stopped for a moment,
leaning against the walls owing to slight attacks
of dizziness. The car shot down to their
floor and the girl entered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by and good luck, my dear,&rdquo; said
the kindly nurse. &ldquo;Take good care of yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she hurried back to the ward, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
another suffering woman was being laid on
the bed just vacated.</p>
<p>Madge found herself on the street, carrying
the little bag which, in spite of its light
weight, was a heavy burden for her. The air
was cold and a slight drizzle had followed the
snow. The chilly dampness made her teeth
chatter. Twice she had to hold on to the iron
rails outside the gates of the hospital, for a
moment&rsquo;s rest. After this she made a brave
effort and, hurrying as best she could, reached
Third Avenue and waited for a car. There
was room in it, fortunately, and she did not
have to stand up. Further down town she got
out, walked half a block west, and stopped
before a tenement-house, opening the door.
The three flights up proved a long journey.
She collapsed on a kitchen chair as soon as she
entered. A woman who had been in the front
room hastened to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re all right again,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Last week the doctor said &rsquo;t was nip and
tuck with you. You didn&rsquo;t know me when I
stood before ye. My! But you don&rsquo;t look
very chipper yet! I&rsquo;ll make ye a cup of hot
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge accepted the refreshment gratefully.
It was rather bitter and black but at
least it was hot and comforting. Then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
went and sought the little bed in the dim hall-room,
whose frosted panes let in a yellow and
scanty light. For this she had been paying a
dollar and a half a week, and owed for the
three she had spent in the hospital. Fortunately,
she still had eleven dollars between
herself and starvation. After paying out
four-fifty the remainder might suffice until
she found more work.</p>
<p>She was weary beyond endurance and yet
sleep would not come to her, as happens often
to the overtired. Before her closed eyes a
vague panorama of past events unrolled itself,
a dismal vision indeed.</p>
<p>There was the coming to the great city,
after the widowed mother&rsquo;s death, from a village
up the state. The small hoard of money
she brought with her melted away rather fast,
in spite of the most economical living. But
at last she had obtained work in a factory
where they made paper boxes and paid a
salary nearly, but not quite, adequate to keep
body and soul together. From this she had
drifted to a place where they made shirts.
Here some hundreds of motor-driven sewing-machines
were running and as many girls
bent over the work, feverishly seeking to exceed
the day&rsquo;s stint and make a few cents
extra. A strike in this place sent her to another,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
with different work, which kept her
busy till the hands were laid off for part of
the summer.</p>
<p>And always, in every place, she toiled doggedly,
determinedly, and her pretty face
would attract the attention of foremen or even
of bosses. Chances came for improvement in
her situation, but the propositions were nearly
always accompanied by smirks and smiles, by
hints never so well covered but that they
caused her heart to beat in indignation and
resentment. Sometimes, of course, they
merely aroused vague suspicions. Two or
three times she accepted such offers. The
result always followed that she left the place,
hurriedly, and sought elsewhere, trudging
through long streets of mercantile establishments
and factories, looking at signs displayed
on bits of swinging cardboard or pasted to
dingy panes.</p>
<p>Throughout this experience, however, she
managed to escape absolute want. She discovered
the many mysteries which, once revealed,
permit of continued existence of a
sort. The washing in a small room, that had
to be done on a Sunday; the making of small
and unnutritious dishes on a tiny alcohol
stove; the reliance on suspicious eggs and
milk turned blue; the purchase of things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
from push-carts. She envied the girls who
knew stenography and typewriting, and those
who were dressmakers and fitters and milliners,
all of which trades necessitate long apprenticeship.
The quiet life at home had not
prepared her to earn her own living. It was
only after the mother&rsquo;s death that an expired
annuity and a mortgage that could not be
satisfied had sent her away from her home, to
become lost among the toilers of a big city.</p>
<p>For a year she had worked, and her clothing
was mended to the verge of impending
ruin, and her boots leaked, and she had grown
thin, but life still held out hope of a sort, a
vague promise of better things, some day, at
some dim period that would be reached later,
ever so much later, perhaps. For she had
still her youth, her courage, her indomitable
tendency towards the things that were decent
and honest and fair.</p>
<p>At last she got a better position as saleswoman
in one of the big stores, whereupon
her sky became bluer and the world took on
rosier tints. She was actually able to save a
little money, cent by cent and dime by dime,
and her cheerfulness and courage increased
apace.</p>
<p>It was at this time that typhoid struck her
down and the big hospital saw her for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
first time. For seven long weeks she remained
there, and when finally she was able to return
to the great emporium she found that help
was being laid off, owing to small trade after
the holidays. She sought further but the same
conditions prevailed and she was thankful to
find harder and more scantily paid work in
another factory, in which she packed unending
cases with canned goods that came in a
steady flow, over long leather belts.</p>
<p>So she became thinner again, and wearier,
but held on, knowing that the big stores would
soon seek additional help. The winter had
come again, and with it a bad cough which,
perforce, she neglected. One day she could
not rise from her bed and the woman who
rented a room to her called in the nearest doctor
who, after a look at the patient and a swift,
understanding gaze at the surroundings, ordered
immediate removal to the hospital.</p>
<p>So now she was out of the precincts of suffering
again, but the world had become a very
hard place, an evil thing that grasped bodies
and souls and churned them into a struggling,
crying, weeping mass for which nothing but
despair loomed ahead. She would try again,
however. She would finish wearing out the
soles of her poor little boots in a further hunt
for work. At last sleep came to her, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
next morning she awoke feeling hungry, and
perhaps a bit stronger. Some sort of sunlight
was making its way through the murky air.
She breakfasted on a half-bottle of milk and
a couple of rolls and went out again, hollow-eyed,
weary looking, to look for more work.</p>
<p>For the best part of three days she staggered
about the streets of the big city, answering
advertisements found in a penny paper, looking
up the signs calling for help, that were
liberally enough displayed in the manufacturing
district.</p>
<p>Then, one afternoon, she sank down upon a
bench in one of the smaller parks, utterly
weary and exhausted. Beside her, on the seat,
lay a paper which she picked up, hoping to
find more calls for willing workers. But
despair was clutching at her heart. In most
of the places they had looked at her and
shaken their heads. No! They had just found
the help they wanted. The reason of her
disappointments, she realized, lay in the fact
that she looked so ill and weary. They did
not deem her capable of doing the needed
work, in spite of her assurances.</p>
<p>So she held up the paper and turned over
one or two pages, seeking the title. It was the
<i>Matrimonial Journal</i>! It seemed like a scurrilous
joke on the part of fate. What had she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
to do with matrimony; with hopes for a
happy, contented home and surcease of the
never-ending search for the pittance that
might keep her alive? She hardly knew why
she folded it and ran the end into the poor
little worn plush muff she carried. When
she reached her room again she lighted the
lamp and looked it over. It was merely something
with which to pass a few minutes of the
long hours. She read some of those advertisements
and the keen instinct that had become
hers in little less than two years of hard
city life made her feel the lack of genuineness
and honesty pervading those proposals
and requests. When she chanced to look at
that far demand from Canada, however, she
put the paper down and began to dream.</p>
<p>Her earlier and blessed years had been
spent in a small place. Her memory went
back to wide pastures and lowing cattle, to
gorgeously blossoming orchards whose trees
bent under their loads of savory fruit, long
after the petals had fallen. She felt as if she
could again breathe unpolluted air, drink
from clear springs and sit by the edges of
fields and watch the waves of grain bending
with flashes of gold before the breezes. Time
and again she had longed for these things;
the mere thought of them brought a hunger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
to her for the open country, for the glory of
distant sunsets, for the sounds of farm and
byre, for the silently flowing little river, bordered
with woodlands that became of gold
and crimson in the autumn. She could again
see the nesting swallows, the robins hopping
over grasslands, the wild doves pairing in the
poplars, the chirping chickadees whose tiny
heads shone like black diamonds, as they
flitted in the bushes. The memory of it all
brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>What a wonderful outlook this thing presented,
as she read it again. A home by a
beautiful river! A prosperous youth who
needed but kindliness and affection to make
him happy! Why had he not found a suitable
mate in that country? She remembered hearing,
or reading somewhere, that women are
comparatively few in the lands to which men
rush to settle in wildernesses. And perhaps
the women he had met were not of the education
or training he had been accustomed to.</p>
<p>The idea of love, as it had been presented
by the men she had been thrown with, in factory
and office, was repugnant to her. But,
if this was true, the outlook was a different
one. Not for a moment did she imagine that
it was a place wherein a woman might live
in idleness and comparative luxury. No!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Such a man would require a helpmeet, one
who would do the work of his house, one who
would take care of the home while he toiled
outside. What a happy life! What a wondrous
change from all that she had experienced!
There were happy women in the
world, glorying in maternity, watching eagerly
for the home-coming of their mates,
blessed with the love of a good man and happy
to return it in full measure. It seemed too
good to be true. She stared with moistened
eyes. If this was really so the man had doubtless
already received answers and chosen.
There must be so many others looking like
herself for a haven of safety, for deliverance
from lives that were unendurable. Who was
she that she should aspire to this thing? To
such a man she could bring but health impaired,
but the remnants of her former
strength. In a bit of looking-glass she saw
her dark-rimmed eyes and deemed that she
had lost all such looks as she had once
possessed.</p>
<p>Yet something kept urging her. It was
some sort of a fraud, doubtless. The man
was probably not in earnest. A letter from
her would obtain no attention from him. A
minute later she was seated at the table, in
spite of all these misgivings, and writing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
this man she had never seen or heard of. She
stated candidly that life had been too hard
for her and that she would do her best to be
a faithful and willing helper to a man who
would treat her kindly. It was a poor little
despairing letter whose words sounded like a
call for rescue from the deep. After she had
finished it she threw it aside, deciding that it
was useless to send it. An hour later she
rushed out of the house, procured a stamp at
the nearest drug-store, and threw the letter in
a box at the street-corner. As soon as it was
beyond her reach she would have given anything
to recall it. Her pale face had become
flushed with shame. A postman came up just
then, who took out a key fastened to a brass
chain. She asked him to give her back her
letter. But he swept up all the missives and
locked the box again, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, miss,&rdquo; he told her, gruffly.</p>
<p>Before her look of disappointment he
halted a few seconds to explain some measure,
full of red-tape, by which she might perhaps
obtain the letter again from the post-office.
To Madge it seemed quite beyond the powers
of man to accomplish such a thing. And,
moreover, the die was cast. The thing might
as well go. She would never hear from it
again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>The next day she found work in a crowded
loft, poorly ventilated and heated, and came
home to throw herself upon her bed, exhausted.
Her landlady&rsquo;s children were making
a terrible noise in the next room, and the
racket shot pains through her head. On the
morrow she was at work again, and kept it up
to the end of the week. When she returned on
Saturday, late in the afternoon, with her
meagre pay-envelope in her ragged muff, she
had forgotten all about her effort to obtain
freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a letter for ye here, from foreign
parts,&rdquo; announced Mrs. MacRae. &ldquo;Leastwise
&rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t an American stamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge took it from her, wondering. A
queer tremor came over her. The man had
written!</p>
<p>Once in her room she tore the envelope
open. The handwriting was queer and irregular.
But a man may write badly and still
be honest and true. And the words she read
were wonderful. This individual, who
merely signed A. B. C., was eager to have her
come to him. She would be treated with the
greatest respect. If the man and the place
were not suited to her she would naturally be
at liberty to return immediately. It was unfortunate
that his occupations absolutely prevented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
his coming over at once to New York
to meet her. If she would only come he felt
certain that she would be pleased. The hosts
of friends he had would welcome her.</p>
<p>Thus it ran for three pages and Madge
stared at the light, a tremendous longing tearing
at her soul, a great fear causing her heart
to throb.</p>
<p>She forgot the meagre supper she had
brought with her and finally sat down to write
again. Like the first letter it was a sort of
confession. She acknowledged again that life
no longer offered any prospect of happiness
to her. After she looked again in the little
glass she wrote that she was not very good-looking.
To her own eyes she now appeared
ugly. But she said she knew a good deal
about housekeeping, which was true, and was
willing to work and toil for a bit of kindness
and consideration. Her face was again red
as she wrote. There was something in all this
that shocked her modesty, her inborn sense of
propriety and decency. But, after all, she
reflected that men and women met somehow,
and became acquainted. And the acquaintance,
in some cases, became love. And the
love eventuated in the only really happy life
a man or a woman could lead.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>Nearly another week went by before the
second answer arrived. It again urged her to
come. It spoke of the wonderful place Carcajou
was, of the marvel that was Roaring
Falls, of the greatness of the woodlands of
Ontario. Indeed, for one of her limited attainments,
Sophy&rsquo;s letter was a remarkable
effort. This time the missive was signed in
printed letters: HUGO ENNIS. This
seemed queer. But some men signed in very
puzzling fashion and this one had used this
method, in all likelihood, in order that she
might be sure to get the name right. And it
was a pleasant-sounding name, rather manly
and attractive.</p>
<p>The letter did not seem to require another
answer. Madge stuffed it under her pillow
and spent a restless night. On the next day
her head was in a whirl of uncertainty. She
went as far as the Grand Central Station and
inquired about the price of a ticket to Carcajou.
The man had to look for some time before
he could give her the information. It
was very expensive. The few dollars in her
pocket were utterly inadequate to such a journey,
and she returned home in despair.</p>
<p>On the Monday morning, at the usual hour,
she started for the factory. She was about to
take the car when she turned back and made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
her way to her room again. Her mind was
made up. She would go!</p>
<p>She opened a tiny trunk she had brought
with her from her country home and searched
it, swiftly, hurriedly. She was going. It
would not do to hesitate. It was a chance.
She must take it!</p>
<p>She pulled out a little pocketbook and
opened it swiftly. Within it was a diamond
ring. It had been given to her mother by her
father, in times of prosperity, as an engagement
ring. And she had kept it through all
her hardships, vaguely feeling that a day
might come when it might save her life. She
had gone very hungry, many a time, with that
gaud in her possession. She had felt that she
could not part with it, that it was something
that had been a part of her own dear mother,
a keepsake that must be treasured to the very
last. And now the moment had come. She
placed the little purse in her muff, clenched
her hand tightly upon it, and went out again
into the street.</p>
<p>She looked out upon the thoroughfare in a
new, impersonal way. She felt as if now she
were only passing through the slushy streets
on her way to new lands. From the tracks of
the Elevated Road dripped great drops of
turbid water. The sky was leaden and an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
easterly wind, in spite of the thaw, brought
the chill humidity that is more penetrating
than colder dry frost.</p>
<p>She hastened along the sidewalk flooded
with the icy grime of the last snowfall. It
went through the thin soles of her worn boots.
Once she shivered in a way that was suggestive
of threatened illness and further resort
to the great hospital. Before crossing the
avenue she was compelled to halt, as the great
circular brooms of a monstrous sweeper shot
forth streams of brown water and melting
snow. Then she went on, casting glances at
the windows of small stores, and finally
stopped before a little shop, dark and uninviting,
whose soiled glass front revealed odds
and ends of old jewelry, watches, optical
goods and bric-a-brac that had a sordid aspect.
She had long ago noticed the ancient
sign disposed behind the panes. It bore the
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We buy Old Gold and Jewelry&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment only she hesitated. Her
breath came and went faster as if a sudden
pain had shot through her breast. But at once
she entered the place. From the back of the
store a grubby, bearded, unclean old man
wearing a black skullcap looked at her keenly
over the edge of his spectacles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I want to sell a diamond,&rdquo; she told
him, uneasily.</p>
<p>He stared at her again, studying her poor
garb, noticing the gloveless hands, appraising
the worn garments she wore. He was rubbing
thin long-fingered hands together and shaking
his head, in slow assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to be very careful,&rdquo; his voice
quavered. &ldquo;We have to know the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go, of course,&rdquo; she answered
swiftly, &ldquo;because you don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the place was inexpressibly
distasteful to her and the old man&rsquo;s
manner was sneaking and suspicious. She
felt that he suspected her of being a thief.
Her shaking hand was already on the doorknob
when he called her back, hurrying
towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry? Come back!&rdquo; he
called to her. &ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t take risks.
There&rsquo;s cases when the goods ain&rsquo;t come by
honest. But you look all right. Anyway
&rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t no trouble to look over the stuff. Let
me see what you&rsquo;ve got. There ain&rsquo;t another
place in New York where they pay such good
prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned, hesitatingly, and handed to
him a small worn case that had once been
covered with red morocco. He opened it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
taking out the ring and moving nearer the
window, where he examined it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s a diamond all right,&rdquo; he admitted,
paternally, as if he thus conferred a
great favor upon her. &ldquo;But of course it&rsquo;s
very old and the mounting was done years
and years ago, and it&rsquo;s worn awful thin.
Maybe a couple of dollars worth of gold,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the stone?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, just a moment, I&rsquo;m looking
at it,&rdquo; he replied, screwing a magnifying glass
in the socket of one of his eyes. &ldquo;Diamonds
are awful hard to sell, nowadays&ndash;&ndash;very hard,
but let me look some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was turning the thing around, estimating
the depth of the gem and studying the
method of its cutting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very old,&rdquo; he told her again. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t cut diamonds that way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belonged to my mother,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; he quavered, repellently,
so that her cheeks began to feel hot
again. She was deeply hurt by his tone of
suspicion. The sacrifice was bad enough&ndash;&ndash;the
implication was unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you want it,&rdquo; she said,
coldly. &ldquo;Give it back to me. I can perhaps
do better at a regular pawnshop.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>But he detained her again, becoming
smooth and oily. He first offered her fifty
dollars. She truthfully asserted that her
father had paid a couple of hundred for it.
After long bargaining and haggling he finally
agreed to give her eighty-five dollars and,
worn out, the girl accepted. She was going
out of the shop, with the money, when she
stopped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that I used to see pistols,
or were they revolvers, in your show window,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>He lifted up his hands in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pistols! revolvers! Don&rsquo;t you know
there&rsquo;s the Sullivan law now? We ain&rsquo;t allowed
to sell &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;and you ain&rsquo;t allowed to
buy &rsquo;em without a license&ndash;&ndash;a license from
the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going away from New York and I thought it
might be a good idea to have one with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked keenly at her again,
scratching one ear with unkempt nails. Finally
he drew her back of a counter, placing a
finger to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking chances,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it to oblige. If ye tell any one
you got it here I&rsquo;ll say you never did. My
word&rsquo;s as good as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m going away,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m never coming to this city again&ndash;&ndash;never
as long as I live. But I want to take
it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she finally went out she carried a
cheap little weapon worth perhaps four dollars,
and a box of cartridges, for which she
paid him ten of the dollars he had handed
out to her. It was with a sense of inexpressible
relief that she found herself again
on the avenue, in spite of the drizzle that was
coming down. The air seemed purer after
her stay in the uninviting place. Its atmosphere
as well as the old man&rsquo;s ways had made
her feel as if she had been engaged in a very
illicit transaction. She met a policeman who
was swinging his club, and the man gave her
an instant of carking fear. But he paid not
the slightest heed to her and she went on,
breathing more freely. It was as if the great
dark pall of clouds hanging over the city was
being torn asunder. At any rate the world
seemed to be a little brighter.</p>
<p>She went home and deposited her purchase,
going out again at once. She stopped at a
telegraph office where the clerk had to consult
a large book before he discovered that
messages could be accepted for Carcajou in
the Province of Ontario, and wrote out the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
few words announcing her coming. After
this she went into other shops, carefully consulting
a small list she had made out. Among
other things she bought a pair of stout boots
and a heavy sweater. With these and a very
few articles of underwear, since she could
spare so little, she returned to the Grand Central
and purchased the needed ticket, a long
thing with many sections to be gradually torn
off on the journey. Berths on sleepers, she
decided, were beyond her means. Cars were
warm, as a rule, and as long as she wasn&rsquo;t
frozen and starving she could endure anything.
Not far from the house she lived in
there was an express office where a man
agreed to come for her trunk, in a couple of
hours.</p>
<p>Then she climbed up to Mrs. MacRae&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave you,&rdquo; announced the
girl. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have found something out of
town. Of course I&rsquo;ll pay for the whole
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman expressed her regret, which
was genuine. Her lodger had never been
troublesome and the small rent she paid
helped out a very poor income mostly derived
from washing and scrubbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s a good job ye&rsquo;ve found, child,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know for sure what kind o&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
place ye&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to? Are you certain it&rsquo;s all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! If it isn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll make it so,&rdquo; answered
Madge, cryptically, as she went over to her
room. Here, from beneath the poor little
iron bed, she dragged out a small trunk and
began her packing. For obvious reasons this
did not take very long. It was a scanty trousseau
the bride was taking with her to the other
wilderness. After her clothes and few other
possessions had been locked in, the room
looked very bare and dismal. She sat on the
bed, holding a throbbing head that seemed
very hot with hands that were quite cold.
After a time the expressman came and removed
the trunk. There was a lot of time
to spare yet and Madge remained seated.
Thoughts by the thousand crowded into her
brain&ndash;&ndash;the gist of them was that the world
was a terribly harsh and perilous place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t stay here any longer!&rdquo; she
suddenly decided, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll get too scared to
go. I&ndash;&ndash;I must start now! I&rsquo;ll wait in the
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she bade Mrs. MacRae good-by, after
handing her a dollar and a half, and received
a tearful blessing. Then, carrying out a small
handbag, she found herself once more on the
sidewalk and began to breathe more freely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
The die was cast now. She was leaving all
this mud and grime and was gambling on a
faint chance of rest and comfort, with her
dead mother&rsquo;s engagement ring, the very last
thing of any value that she had hitherto managed
to keep. It was scarcely happiness that
she expected to find. If only this man might
be good to her, if only he placed her beyond
danger of immediate want, if only he treated
her with a little consideration, life would become
bearable again!</p>
<p>As she walked along the avenue the pangs
of hunger came to her, keenly. For once she
would have a sufficient meal! She entered a
restaurant and ordered lavishly. Hot soup,
hot coffee, hot rolls, a dish of steaming stew
with mashed potatoes, and finally a portion of
hot pudding, furnished her with a meal such
as she had not tasted for months and months.
A sense of comfort came to her, and she placed
five cents on the table as a tip to the girl who
had waited on her. She was feeling ever so
much better as she went out again. She had
spent fifty cents for one meal, like a woman
rolling in wealth. At a delicatessen shop she
purchased a loaf of bread and a box of crackers,
with a little cold meat. She knew that
meals on trains were very expensive.</p>
<p>As she reached the station she felt that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
had burned her bridges behind her. She
could never come back, since the few dollars
that were left would never pay for her return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not coming back,&rdquo; she told herself
grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m my own master now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the bottom of her little bag. Yes,
the pistol was there, a protector from insult
or a means towards that end she no longer
dreaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll never come back!&rdquo; she repeated
to herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never see this city
again. It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s been too hard, too cruelly
hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was glad to sit down at last on one
of the big benches in the waiting-room. It
was nice and warm, at any rate, and the seat
was comfortable enough. Her arm had begun
to ache from carrying the bag, and she
had done so much running about that her legs
felt weary and shaky. A woman sitting opposite
looked at her for an instant and turned
away. There was nothing to interest any one
in the garments just escaping shabbiness, or
in the pale face with its big dark-rimmed eyes.
People are very unconscious, as a rule, of the
tragedy, the drama or the comedy being
enacted before their eyes.</p>
<p>Gradually Madge began to feel a sense of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
peace stealing over her. She was actually
beginning to feel contented. It was a chance
worth taking, since things could never be
worse. And then there was that thing in her
bag. Presently a woman came to sit quite
close to her with a squalling infant in her
arms and another standing at her knee. She
was a picture of anxiety and helplessness.
But after a time a man came, bearing an old
cheap suit-case tied up with clothes-line, who
spoke in a foreign tongue as the woman
sighed with relief and a smile came over her
face.</p>
<p>Yes! That was it! The coming of the man
had solved all fears and doubts! There was
security in his care and protection. With a
catch in her breathing the girl&rsquo;s thoughts flew
over vast unknown expanses and went to that
other man who was awaiting her. Her vivid
imagination presented him like some strange
being appearing before her under forms that
kept changing. The sound of his voice was a
mystery to her and she had not the slightest
idea of his appearance. That advertisement
stated that he was young and the first letter
had hinted that he possessed fair looks. Yet
moments came in which the mere idea of him
was terrifying, and this, in swiftly changing
moods, changed to forms that seemed to bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
her peace, a surcease of hunger and cold, of
unavailing toil, of carking fear of the morrow.</p>
<p>At times she would look about her, and the
surroundings would become blurred, as if she
had been weeping. The hastening people
moved as if through a heavy mist and the
announcer&rsquo;s voice, at intervals, boomed out
loudly and called names that suggested nothing
to her. Again her vision might clear and
she would notice little trivial things, a bewildered
woman dragging a pup that was
most unwilling, a child hauling a bag too
heavy for him, a big negro with thumbs in
the armholes of his vest, yawning ponderously.
For the hundredth time she looked at
the big clock and found that she still had over
an hour to wait for her train. Again she lost
sight of the ever-changing throngs, of the
massive structure in which she seemed to be
lost, and the roar of the traffic faded away in
the long backward turning of her brain, delving
into the past. There was the first timid
yet hopeful coming to the big city and the
discovery that a fair high-school education,
with some knowledge of sewing and fancywork,
was but poor merchandise to exchange
for a living. Her abundance of good looks,
at that time, had proved nothing but a hindrance
and a danger. Then had come the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
bitter toil for a pittance, and sickness, and the
hospital, and the long period of convalescence
during which everything but the ring had
been swept away. She had met the sharp
tongues of slatternly, disappointed landladies,
while she looked far and wide for work. At
first she had been compelled to ask girls on
the street for the meaning of cards pasted on
windows or hanging in doorways. Words
such as &ldquo;Bushel girls on pants&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stockroom
assistants&rdquo; had signified nothing to her.
Month by month she had worked in shops
and factories where the work she exacted
from her ill-nourished body sapped her
strength and thinned her blood. Nor could
she compete with many of the girls, brought
up to such labor, smart, pushing, inured to an
existence carried on with the minimum of
food and respirable air.</p>
<p>The red came to her cheeks again as she
remembered insults that had been proffered
to her. It deepened further as she thought of
that paper picked up on a bench of a little
city square. The fear of having made a terrible
mistake returned to her, more strongly
than ever. Her efforts towards peace now
seemed immodest, bold, unwomanly. But
that first vision had been so keen of a quiet-voiced
man extending a strong hand to welcome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
and protect as he smiled at her in pleasant
greeting! Her vague notions of a far
country in which was no wilderness of brick
and mortar but only the beauty of smiling
fields or of scented forests had filled her heart
with a passionate longing. And the last thing
the doctor had told her, in the hospital, was
that she ought to live far away from the city,
in the pure air of God&rsquo;s country. It was with
a hot face and a throbbing heart that she now
remembered the poor little letters she had
written. Even the sending of that telegram
now filled her with shame. And yet....</p>
<p>With clamorous voice the man was announcing
her train. After a heart-rending
moment&rsquo;s hesitation she hastened to where a
few people were waiting. The gates opened
and she was pushed along. It was as if her
own will could no longer lead her, as if she
were being carried by a strong tide, with
other jetsam, towards shores unknown.</p>
<p>At last she was seated in an ordinary coach,
than which man has never devised sorrier
accommodation for a long journey. Finally
the train started and she sought to look out of
the window but obtained only a blurred impression
of columns and pillars lighted at
intervals by flickering bulbs. They made her
eyes ache. But presently she made out, to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
left, the dark surface of a big river. A few
more lights were glinting upon it, appearing
and disappearing. Vaguely she made out the
outlines of a few vessels that were battling
against the drifting ice, for she could see
myriad sparks flying from what must have
been the smokestacks of tugs or river steamers.</p>
<p>Her fellow passengers were mostly laborers
or emigrants going north or west. The
air was tainted with the scent of garlic. Children
began to cry and later grew silent or
merely fretful. Finally the languor of infinite
weariness came over the girl and she lay
back, uncomfortably, and tried to sleep. At
frequent intervals she awoke and sat up again,
with terror expressed in her face and deep
blue eyes. Once she fell into a dream and
was so startled that she had to restrain herself
from rushing down the aisle and seeking to
escape from some unknown danger that
seemed to be threatening her.</p>
<p>Again she passed a finger over the blurred
glass and sought to look out. The train
seemed to be plunging into strange and grisly
horrors. Overwrought as she was a flood of
tears came to her eyes and seemed to bring her
greater calm, so that at last she fell into a
deeper sleep, heavy, visionless, no longer attended
with sudden terrors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>To Roaring River</span></h3>
</div>
<p>At last the morning came and Madge
awoke. At first she could not realize
where she was. Her limbs ached from their
cramped position and a pain was gnawing at
her, which meant hunger. In spite of the
heaters in the car a persistent chilliness had
come over her, and all at once she was seized
by an immense discouragement. She felt that
she was now being borne away to some terrible
place. Those people called it Roaring
River. Now that she thought of it the very
name represented something that was gruesome
and panicky. But then she lay back and
reflected that its flood would be cleaner and
its bed a better place to leap into, if her fears
were realized, than the turbid waters of the
Hudson. She knew that she was playing her
last stake. It must result in a life that could
be tolerated or else in an end she had battled
against, to the limit of endurance.</p>
<p>She quietly made a meal of the provisions
she had brought. Her weary brain no longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
reacted to disturbing thoughts and vague fears
and she felt that she was drifting, peacefully,
to some end that was by this time nearly indifferent
to her. The day wore on, with a
long interval in Ottawa, where she dully
waited in the station, the restaurant permitting
her to indulge in a comforting cup of
coffee. All that she saw of the town was from
the train. There was a bridge above the
tracks, near the station, and on the outskirts
there were winding and frozen waterways on
which some people skated. As she went on
the land seemed to take an even chillier aspect.
The snow was very deep. Farms and
small villages were half buried in it. The
automobiles and wheeled conveyances of New
York had disappeared. Here and there she
could see a sleigh, slowly progressing along
roads, the driver heavily muffled and the
horse traveling in a cloud of vapor. When
night came they were already in a vast region
of rock and evergreen trees, of swift running
rivers churning huge cakes of ice, and the
dwellings seemed to be very few and far between.
The train passed through a few fairly
large towns, at first, and she noted that the
people were unfamiliarly clad, wearing much
fur, and the inflections of their voices were
strange to her. By this time the train was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
running more slowly, puffing up long grades
and sliding down again with a harsh grinding
of brakes that seemed to complain. When
the moon rose it shone over endless snow,
broken only by dim, solid-looking masses of
conifers. Here and there she could also
vaguely discern rocky ledges upon which
gaunt twisted limbs were reminders of devastating
forest fires. There were also great
smooth places that must have been lakes or
the beds of wide rivers shackled in ice overlaid
with heavy snow. Whenever the door of
the car was opened a blast of cold would
enter, bitingly, and she shivered.</p>
<p>Came another morning which found her
haggard with want of sleep and broken with
weariness. But she knew that she was getting
very near the place and all at once she began
to dread the arrival, to wish vainly that she
might never reach her destination, and this
feeling continued to grow keener and keener.</p>
<p>Finally the conductor came over to her and
told her that the train was nearing her station.
Obligingly he carried her bag close to the
door and she stood up beside him, swaying a
little, perhaps only from the motion of the
car. The man looked at her and his face expressed
some concern but he remained silent
until the train stopped.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>Madge had put on her thin cloak. The
frosted windows of the car spoke of intense
cold and the rays of the rising sun had not yet
passed over the serrated edges of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find it mighty cold,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; ventured the conductor. &ldquo;Hope
you ain&rsquo;t got to go far in them clothes. Maybe
your friends &rsquo;ll be bringing warmer things for
you. Run right into the station; there&rsquo;s a
fire there. Joe &rsquo;ll bring your baggage inside.
Good morning, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She noticed that he was looking at her with
some curiosity, and her courage forsook her
once more. It was as if, for the first time in
her life, she had undertaken to walk into a
lion&rsquo;s cage, with the animal growling and
roaring. She felt upon her cheeks the bite of
the hard frost, but there was no wind and she
was not so very cold, at first. She looked
about her as the train started. Scattered
within a few hundred yards there were perhaps
two score of small frame houses. At
the edge of what might have been a pasture,
all dotted with stumps, stood a large deserted
sawmill, the great wire-guyed sheet-iron pipe
leaning over a little, dismally. A couple of
very dark men she recognized as Indians
looked at her without evincing the slightest
show of interest. From a store across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
street a young woman with a thick head of
red hair peeped out for an instant, staring at
her. Then the door closed again. After this
a monstrously big man with long, tow-colored
wisps of straggling hair showing at the edges
of his heavy muskrat cap, and a ragged beard
of the same color, came to her as she stood
upon the platform, undecided, again a prey
to her fears. The man smiled at her, pleasantly,
and touched his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay tank you&rsquo;re de gal is going ofer to
Hugo Ennis,&rdquo; he said, in a deep, pleasant
voice.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth to answer but the
words refused to come. Her mouth felt unaccountably
dry&ndash;&ndash;she could not swallow.
But she nodded her head in assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took de telegraft ofer to his shack,&rdquo; the
Swede further informed her, &ldquo;but Hugo he
ain&rsquo;t here yet. I tank he come soon. Come
inside de vaiting-room or you freeze qvick.
Ain&rsquo;t you got skins to put on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head and he grasped her bag
with one hand and one of her elbows with the
other and hurried her into the little station.
Joe Follansbee had a redhot fire going in the
stove, whose top was glowing. The man
pointed at a bench upon which she could sit
and stood at her side, shaving tobacco from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
big black plug. She decided that his was a
reassuring figure and that his face was a good
and friendly one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that&ndash;&ndash;that Mr. Ennis will
come soon?&rdquo; she finally found voice to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, ma&rsquo;am. You yoost sit qviet.
If Hugo he expect a leddy he turn up all
right, sure. It&rsquo;s tvelve mile ofer to his place,
ma&rsquo;am, and he ain&rsquo;t got but one dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not quite understand what the
latter fact signified. What mattered it how
many dogs he had? She was going to ask for
further explanation when the door opened
and the young woman who had peeped at her
came in. She was heavily garbed in wool
and fur. As she cast a glance at Madge she
bit her lips. For the briefest instant she hesitated.
No, she would not speak, for fear of
betraying herself, and she went to the window
of the little ticket-office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything for us, Joe?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. There&rsquo;s no express stuff been left,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;Your stuff&rsquo;ll be along by
freight, I reckon. Wait a moment and I&rsquo;ll
give you the mail-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bring it over. It&ndash;&ndash;it doesn&rsquo;t
matter about the goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned about, hastily, and nodded to
big Stefan. Then she peered at Madge again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
with a sidelong look, and left the waiting-room.</p>
<p>As so often happens she had imagined this
woman who was coming as something entirely
different from the reality. She had evolved
vague ideas of some sort of adventuress, such
as she had read of in a few cheap novels that
had found their way to Carcajou. In spite of
the mild and timid tone of the letters she had
prepared to see some sort of termagant, or at
least a woman enterprising, perhaps bold, one
who would make it terribly hot for the man
she would believe had deceived her and
brought her on a fool&rsquo;s errand. This little
thin-faced girl who looked with big, frightened
eyes was something utterly unexpected,
she knew not why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and she ain&rsquo;t at all bad-looking,&rdquo;
she acknowledged to herself, uneasily. &ldquo;She
don&rsquo;t look like she&rsquo;d say &lsquo;Boo&rsquo; to a goose,
either. But then maybe she&rsquo;s deceiving in
her looks. A woman who&rsquo;d come like that
to marry a man she don&rsquo;t know can&rsquo;t amount
to much. Like enough she&rsquo;s a little hypocrite,
with her appearance that butter
wouldn&rsquo;t melt in her mouth. And my! The
clothes she&rsquo;s got on! I wonder if she didn&rsquo;t
look at me kinder suspicious. Seemed as if
she was taking me in, from head to foot.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>In this Miss Sophy was probably mistaken.
Madge had looked at her because the garb of
brightly-edged blanketing, the fur cap and
mitts, the heavy long moccasins, all made a
picture that was unfamiliar. There was perhaps
some envy in the look, or at least the
desire that she also might be as well fended
against the bitter cold. She had the miserable
feeling that comes over both man and woman
when feeling that one&rsquo;s garments are out of
place and ill-suited to the occasion. Once
Madge had seen a moving-picture representing
some lurid drama of the North, and some
of the women in it had worn that sort of
clothing.</p>
<p>Big Stefan had lighted his pipe and sought
a seat that creaked under his ponderous
weight. He opened the door of the stove
and threw two or three large pieces of yellow
birch in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it ain&rsquo;t nefer cold vhere you comes
from,&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll haf to put on
varm tings if you goin&rsquo; all de vay to Roaring
Rifer Falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have nothing warmer than
this,&rdquo; the girl faltered. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t know
it was so very cold here. And&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m
nicely warmed up now, and perhaps I won&rsquo;t
feel it so very much.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You stay right here an&rsquo; vait for me,&rdquo; he
told her, and went out of the waiting-room,
hurriedly. But he opened the door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Hugo he come vhile I am avay, you
tell him I pring youst two three tings from
my voman for you. I&rsquo;m back right avay. So
long, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was left alone for at least a quarter of
an hour, and it reminded her of a long wait
she had undergone in the reception-room of
the hospital. Then, as now, she had feared
the unknown, had shivered at the thought that
presently she would be in the hands of strange
people who might or not be friendly, and be
lost among a mass of suffering humanity.
Twice she heard the runners of sleighs creaking
on the ground, and her heart began to
beat, but the sounds faded away. Joe, the
station agent, came in and asked her civilly
whether she was warm enough, telling her
that outside it was forty below. Wood was
cheap, he told her, and he put more sticks in
the devouring stove. After she had thanked
him and given him the check for her little
trunk he vanished again, and she listened to
the telegraph sounder.</p>
<p>Stefan, returning, was hailed at the door of
the store by Sophy McGurn.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the strange lady, Stefan?&rdquo; she
asked, most innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a leddy vhat is expectin&rsquo; Hugo Ennis,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; said the girl, airily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay dunno,&rdquo; answered the Swede. &ldquo;Vhen
Hugo he do a thing it ain&rsquo;t nefer qveer, Ay
tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away and Stefan stepped over
to the depot and opened the door. Madge
looked up, startled and again afraid. It was
a relief to her to see Stefan&rsquo;s friendly face.
She had feared.... She didn&rsquo;t know what
she dreaded so much&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a face repellent&ndash;&ndash;a
man who would look at her and in
whose eyes she might discern insult or
contempt.</p>
<p>The big Swede held an armful of heavy
clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t stay here, leddy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
come ofer to my house since Ennis he no coming.
Dese clothes is from my ole vomans.
Mebbe ye look like&ndash;&ndash;like de dooce in dem,
but dat&rsquo;s better as to freeze to death. An you
vants a big breakfass so you goes vid me along.
Hey dere! Joe! If Ennis he come you tell
him come ofer to me, ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Madge was trudging
over the beaten snow by the side of her huge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
companion. Her head was ensconced within
the folds of a knitted shawl and over her thin
cloak she wore an immense mackinaw of flaming
hues whose skirts fell &rsquo;way below her
knees. Over her boots, protestingly, she had
drawn on an amazing pair of things made of
heavy felt and ending in thick rubber feet,
that were huge and unwieldy. Her hands
were lost in great scarlet mitts. It is possible
that at this time there was little feminine vanity
left in her, yet she looked furtively to one
side or the other, expecting scoffing glances.
She felt sure that she looked like one of the
fantastically-clad ragamuffins she had seen in
the streets of New York, at Christmas and
Thanksgiving. But the pair met but one or
two Indian women who wore a garb that was
none too &aelig;sthetic and who paid not the slightest
attention to them, and a few men who may
possibly have wondered but, with the instinctive
civility of the North, never revealed their
feelings.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact she had hardly believed
in this cold, at first. The station agent&rsquo;s announcement
had possessed little meaning for
her. There was no wind; the sun was shining
brightly now; during the minute she had remained
on the station platform she had felt
nothing unusual. As a matter of fact she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
enjoyed the keen brisk air after the tepid
stuffiness of the cars. But presently she began
to realize a certain tingling and sharp quality
of the air. The little of her face that was
exposed began to feel stiff and queer. Even
through the heavy clothing she now wore she
seemed to have been plunged in a strange atmosphere.
For an instant, after she finally
reached Stefan&rsquo;s house, the contrast between
the cold outside and the warm living-room,
that was also the kitchen, appeared to suffocate
her.</p>
<p>A tall stout woman waddled towards her,
smiling all over and bidding her a good-day.
She helped remove the now superfluous
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De yoong leddy she come all de vay from
Nev York, vhat is a real hot country, I expect,&rdquo;
explained Stefan, placidly and inaccurately.
&ldquo;Sit down, leddy, an haf sometings
to eat. You needs plenty grub, good an&rsquo; hot,
in dem cold days. Ve sit down now. Here,
Yoe, and you, Yulia, come ofer an&rsquo; talk to de
leddy! Dem&rsquo;s our children, ma&rsquo;am, and de
baby in de grib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge was glad to greet the rosy, round-cheeked
children, who advanced timidly
towards her and stared at her out of big blue
eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>Hesitatingly she took the seat Stefan had
indicated with a big thumb, and suddenly a
ravenous hunger came upon her. The great
pan full of sizzling bacon and fat pork; the
steaming and strongly scented coffee; the
great pile of thick floury rolls taken out of the
oven, appeared to constitute a repast fit for
the gods. Stefan and his family joined hands
while the mother asked a short blessing, during
which the children were hard put to it to
stop from staring again at the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; ventured the good wife, amiably,
&ldquo;you iss likely de sister from Hugo
Ennis, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge&rsquo;s fork clattered down upon her
enamel-ware plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;of course I&rsquo;m not
his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excoose me. He don&rsquo;t nefer tell nobody
as he vas marrit, Hugo didn&rsquo;t. Ve vas alvays
tinking he vos a bachelor mans, yoost like most
of dem young mans as come to dese countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m not his wife, either!&rdquo;
cried Madge, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t yoost understand, den,&rdquo; said
the good woman, placidly. &ldquo;Oh! mebbe you
help grub-stake him vhile he vork at de rocks
for dat silfer and you come see how he gettin&rsquo;
along. Ve tank he do very vell.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hugo he got some ore as is lookin&rsquo;
very fine, all uncofered alretty,&rdquo; Stefan informed
her. &ldquo;Und it&rsquo;s such a bretty place
he haf at de Falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man doubtless referred to the scenery
but Madge was under the impression that he
was speaking of the house in which this Ennis
lived. It was strange that he had said nothing
to these people, who evidently knew him well,
in regard to the reason of her coming. It was
probably a well-meant discretion that had
guided his conduct, she thought, but it had
caused her some little embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his letter Mr. Ennis said that I was to
come straight to this place, to Carcajou. He
told me that I would be taken to his house at
Roaring River Falls, that I might see it. I&ndash;&ndash;I
suppose there is a village up there or&ndash;&ndash;or
some houses, where I may stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan stared at her, scratching his touzled
yellow head, and turned to his wife, who was
looking at him as she poised a forkful of fat
bacon in the air, forgetfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe de leddy means Papineau&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;But if Hugo Ennis he say for her to
come then it is all right, sure. Hugo vould
do only vhat is right. He is my friend. He
safe my life. So if he don&rsquo;t turn up by de time
ve finish breakfast I hitch up dem togs an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
take you dere real qvick. Mebbe he can&rsquo;t
come for you, some vay. Mebbe Maigan hurt
or sick so he can&rsquo;t pull toboggan. You vant
to go, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I suppose so,&rdquo; faltered the girl. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I
must see him, as soon as possible, and&ndash;&ndash;and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; interrupted Stefan. &ldquo;So
long you vants to go I take you up dere. No
trouble for to do anyting for Hugo and his
friends. De dogs is strong an&rsquo; fresh. Ve go
up there mighty qvick, I bet you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Olsen was not used to question her
husband&rsquo;s decisions. There seemed to be
something rather mysterious about all this,
but she was a placid soul who could wait in
peace for the explanation that would doubtless
be forthcoming. Anyway there was
Papineau&rsquo;s house about a mile away from the
Falls, and the girl could find shelter there.
She smiled at her guest pleasantly and urged
her to eat more. For some minutes Madge&rsquo;s
appetite had forsaken her. But the temptation
of good food in abundance overcame her
alarm. She felt the comfort of a quiet, God-fearing,
civil-spoken household. They were
rough people, in their way, but they seemed so
genuine, so friendly, so full of the desire to
help her and put her at her ease, that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
again reassured. Her hunger assailed her
and she ate what she considered a huge breakfast,
though Stefan Olsen&rsquo;s family seemed to
wonder at her scanty ability to dispose of the
things they piled upon her plate. When
large brown griddle-cakes were finally placed
before her she could eat but a single one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; said the good woman, &ldquo;in Nev
York you ain&rsquo;t used to tings like ve country
people have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Used to them, forsooth! Indeed she had
not been used to such things. She remembered
the small bottles of bluish milk, the
butter doled out in yellow lumps of strong
taste, the couple of rolls that would make a
meal, the cup of tea or coffee of pale hue, the
bits of meat she could afford but once in several
days. No, indeed she had not been used
to such things, in the last two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vhen you stays in dis coontry for a vhiles
den you can eat like a goot feller and not like
a little bird,&rdquo; Stefan assured her, comfortingly.
&ldquo;Den you get nice and fat, and red
on de cheeks, and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Olsen was still smiling at her, as she
sat with plump hands folded on an ample
stomach. The two children had become used
to her and came near. A seat was given to
her near the stove. Lack of sleep during the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
two hard nights spent on the train caused
her head to nod, once or twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you vants to rest a bit before ve
goes,&rdquo; suggested Stefan. &ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s plenty time
if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this roused her to alert attention. She
must go, at once, for all this suspense and uncertainty
must be ended. For some happy
moments she had thought no more of the man
who was expecting her. The comfort she had
enjoyed had temporarily banished him from
her thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;oh, no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be
glad to leave as soon as you are ready to take
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment she became keenly puzzled.
She still had a very few dollars in her purse
and wondered whether she ought to offer payment
for her meal. Instinct wisely prompted
her to keep the little pocketbook in her bag.
They would undoubtedly have been surprised
and perhaps offended.</p>
<p>Stefan drew on his great Dutch stockings
and pulled his fur cap over his ears. An instant
after he had left the room Madge heard
loud barking. As she looked out of the window,
scratching off a little of the frost that
covered the panes, she saw the big Swede surrounded
by five large dogs which he was hitching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
to a toboggan. Then he got on the thing
and the animals galloped away. A few minutes
later he returned, with her small trunk
lashed to the back part of the sled. He entered
the house and took a straw-filled pillow
and a huge bearskin and bore them out.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Mrs. Olsen was helping
Madge to resume her outlandish garb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe Mr. Ennis he not know you vhen
you come so all wrapped up. Mebbe he tink
it is a bear. Yes, put dis on too, you vants it
all,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all of twelve mile
out dere. If you not need de tings no longer,
by and by you send &rsquo;em back. It&rsquo;s all right.
I no need &rsquo;em. Yoost keep &rsquo;em so long vhat
you like. Didn&rsquo;t Hugo Ennis tell you bring
varm clothes vid you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t think
he spoke of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mens is awful foolish some times,&rdquo; asserted
the good woman. &ldquo;Dey pay no attention
to tings everybotty knows all about. I
tank Stefan he alretty now, so I say good-by
and come again, ma&rsquo;am. Alvays happy ter
see you again vhen you comes, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl came to Madge and rose
upon her toes, for a kiss. More timidly the
boy only proffered a hand. Mrs. Olsen kissed
her pale cheek with a resounding smack.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mens is fonny sometimes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If
tings isn&rsquo;t all right like you expect mebbe at
Papineau&rsquo;s you come back here soon as you
finish vhat you haf to do at Roaring Rifer. I
haf anodder bed I can fix up in de back room
real easy. Good py, ma&rsquo;am, and look out
careful for your nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this incomprehensible bit of advice
Mrs. Olsen opened the door, swiftly, and
closed it just as fast. Madge saw her smiling
at her through the window-pane. Stefan
made her sit down on the pillow, over which
he had laid the bearskin, which he then
wrapped over her shoulders and body and
limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ve starts right off,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;Look out careful for your nose, leddy,&rdquo; he
also advised before calling to his dogs, who
strained away at the long traces and trotted
away, pulling heartily.</p>
<p>Wearing a pair of huge snowshoes Stefan
followed or kept at the side of the toboggan.
They left the road and struck a sort of path
that led them up a hill. To her right hand
she could see a vast expanse of frozen lake
stretching away to the north. In some places
the snow appeared to be quite level while in
others it was deeply wrinkled in ridges caused
by the winds. Presently the trees grew more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
abundant along the way. They were silvery
birches and the yellow ones, and poplars with
slender branches ending in tiny bare twigs.
The conifers still wore thick coats of dark
green, excepting the tamaracks, that only carried
a few long golden needles. These big
trees were dotted over with great lumps of
snow and ice which occasionally clattered
down through the branches.</p>
<p>Madge looked up and the world seemed to
assume a wondrous new beauty such as she
had never known. The blue above was wonderfully
clear and bright. Over the snow the
sunlight was beating strongly, though it appeared
to give little or no heat. Yet in the
great patches of shadow through which they
passed at times it felt colder still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoost keep on feelin&rsquo; yer nose,&rdquo; Stefan
told her, as the dogs rested for a moment at
the top of a small hill. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t let it
get frost-bited, ma&rsquo;am. It ain&rsquo;t such a awful
big nose you got, leddy, but you sure vouldn&rsquo;t
look so bretty if it drop off. Ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed out loudly, apparently enjoying
his ponderous joke greatly, but she felt
that she must heed his advice and frequently
carried the big mitt Mrs. Olsen had lent her
to her face. They came to a great expanse of
deep forest where, in places, the ground was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
nearly bare of snow. The pulling was hard
here and the dogs toiled along more slowly
and panted as their cloudy breaths rose in
steamy puffs. Madge admired them. They
seemed such strong, willing animals. When
they rested for a moment they would lie down
and bite off the little balls of ice that formed
beneath their toes, but at a word they would
leap up again and throw themselves against
their breast-bands, eagerly. In one difficult
place Madge protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor things are working so hard,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I get out and walk for a
while? I don&rsquo;t feel tired at all now, but your
poor dogs do, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Stefan. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t
tired. They yoost look so because they work
hard. In dis country togs and men has to
work hard or go hoongry. In a moment you
sees how dey run again, vhen dey get good
going. Dem togs can go dis vay all day and
be fresh again to-morrow. Eferybody here
knows vhat my team o&rsquo; togs can do, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that he was proud of them,
and Madge decided that it was with good
reason. They had started again and reached
an expanse of burnt land, upon which the
snow was crusted and the road was on a down
grade. The team that had panted so hard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
with lolling tongues, threw itself into the collars
and trotted off again, briskly, while Stefan
followed with the short-stepped and effortless
flat-footed run that covers so much ground in
the north. The girl had to balance herself
rather carefully at times, for the surface was
by no means a level one. The toboggan
swayed and bumped over hidden things that
may have been stumps or rocks, or great
buried ruts of the previous fall.</p>
<p>It was all so new and wonderful! A sense
of enjoyment actually stole over her. But for
the feeling of stiffness in her face she felt
comfortably warm. Without ever meeting a soul,
through a country that seemed utterly deserted
of man, they went on for several miles. Once
Stefan stopped the toboggan in order to show
her tracks of a bear. It was wonderful to
think that such animals roamed about her.
The Swede told her that they were utterly
harmless, that they always fled as soon as their
keen eyes or sharp ears revealed the neighborhood
of their enemies, the men who coveted
their thick and long-haired hides worth a
good many dollars. But she saw few living
things; once there was a great snowy owl that
rose heavily and then flew swiftly and in
silence from a stump in a <i>brul&eacute;</i>, disappearing
among the trees like an animated shadow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
yes, a shadow of sudden death to hares and
partridges cowering beneath the fronds of
wide-spreading conifers or in the great tangles
of frost-killed long grasses.</p>
<p>It was altogether another world, strange
and of rugged beauty. She felt as if she had
been transported from the seething city into
the vast peace of some landscape of moon or
stars. Every bit of the old harsh world was
now left behind and there was no longer any
hint of cruelty in the snowy plains and hills
and forest; nothing reminded her of despairing
hunger, of the disbelief that had stolen
upon her in the possibility of eking out much
longer a life that was too hard to sustain.
What if her errand seemed fantastic, unreal,
since this new world also was like some illusion
of a dream? The great stillness appeared
to be friendly&ndash;&ndash;the bent tops of snow-laden
trees surely bowed a welcome to her&ndash;&ndash;the
shining sun and the pure air, in spite of bitter
cold, drove the blood more rapidly through
her veins and she no longer deemed life to be
a mere form of suffering, such as she had undergone
during the last year of her losing
contest in the cruel, pitiless town.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Stefan trudged behind in a
narrow part of the old tote-road, a big white
hare crossed the path ahead of the dogs, perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
seeking to escape the pursuit of some
marten or weasel. At once the team broke
into a headlong gallop, a helter-skelter pursuit,
while their master roared at them unavailingly.
Down a small declivity they flew.
A moment later one side of the toboggan rose
suddenly and the passenger felt herself being
shot off into the snow. As the sled upset the
little trunk lashed to its back caught into something
and firmly anchored the whole contrivance,
a few yards further on, and perforce
the animals stopped with hanging tongues and
steaming breaths.</p>
<p>An instant later Stefan was helping Madge
arise. He looked at her in deep concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dem tamn togs!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;I hope
you ain&rsquo;t hurted none, leddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his assistance she rose quickly from
the snow. It is possible that she had scarcely
had time enough to become afraid. At any
rate this new life that had come to her asserted
itself, irresistibly, for there was something in
its essence that would not be denied. In the
heart that had been overburdened something
broke, like a flood bursting its bonds. She
threw up her head and uplifted her hands as
laughter, pealing and rippling unrestrained,
shook her slender frame from head to foot
until tears ran down the now reddened cheeks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
and turned to tiny globes of ice. She was
making up for weeks and months of sombre
thoughts, of despair, of shrewd suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tank gootness!&rdquo; roared Stefan. &ldquo;First
I tink dem togs yoost kill you dead. If so I
take de pelts off &rsquo;em all alife, de scoundrels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Please don&rsquo;t punish them,&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it was so funny! Oh, dear!
I&ndash;&ndash;I must stop laughing! It&ndash;&ndash;it hurts my
sides!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran off among the dogs and threw herself
down on the crusted snow, passing one
arm over a shaggy back. The animal looked
at her, uncertainly, but suddenly he passed a
big moist tongue over her face. Could he
have realized that her saving grace might
avert condign punishment? The girl petted
him as Stefan turned the toboggan and its
load right side up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t feared of dem togs,&rdquo; he called
to her. &ldquo;And you vasn&rsquo;t afraid vhen dey
dump you out. You&rsquo;s a blucky gal all right,
leddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later she was again wrapped up
in the bearskin and the dogs, loudly threatened
but unpunished, owing to her intercession,
resumed their journey. They had gone but
a few hundred yards further when Madge
smelled wood-smoke. A few minutes later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
they came in sight of a low-built shack of
heavy planks evidently turned out in a sawpit
and resting on walls of peeled spruce logs.
The dogs trotted toward it and a woman came
out as Stefan stopped his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a letter for you, Mis&rsquo; Carew,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;I got it dis morning at de post-office
and bring it as I come along dis vay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He searched a pocket of his coat while the
woman looked at Madge curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in and warm yourself a
while?&rdquo; she asked, civilly. &ldquo;I can make you
a hot cup of tea in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! Thank you ever so much,&rdquo;
answered Madge. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I think we&rsquo;d better
hurry on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan had found the letter and handed it
to Mrs. Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Stefan, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked the woman. &ldquo;There might possibly be
some message you could take for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man lit his pipe while the woman went
indoors. A moment later she came out,
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Stefan,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
you came. My man&rsquo;s away with the dogs,
gone after a load of moose-meat, and won&rsquo;t
be back till to-morrow. And my daughter
Mary&rsquo;s very sick at Missanaibie and wants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
me to come right over. Could you take me
over to the depot in time for the afternoon
train west? Are you going back to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan pulled out a big silver watch and
studied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m yoost
goin&rsquo; over to Hugo&rsquo;s wid dis leddy. If I go
real smart I can get back in time, but I got to
hurry a bit. So long! I come right soon back.
Leave a vord for Tom und be ready de moment
I come. I make it, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this assurance he started off again,
while the woman was still crying out her
thanks. There was a long bit of good going
now, which they covered at a good pace.
Madge was thinking how helpful all these
people were, how naturally they gave, how
readily they asked for the help that was always
welcome, as far as she could see. Yes,
it was all so very different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the dogs be dreadfully tired,&rdquo; she
asked, &ldquo;if you go back so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, leddy,&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;Twenty-four
miles ain&rsquo;t much of a trip. Dey make tvice
dat if need come. And me too, sure t&rsquo;ing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she looked at him she knew that he spoke
the simple truth. Even the people of this
country seemed to be built differently. All of
them looked sturdy, self-reliant, strong to endure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
and, more than anything, ready to share
everything either with stranger or with friend.
In spite of the weariness she felt after her long
journey and of the ache in her bones that was
coming from the unusual manner of her travelling,
she felt that this was a blessed country,
a haven of rest that held promise of wonderful
peace. All at once they came in sight of a
river, snow-shackled like all the others, except
for black patches where the under-running
flood so hurried in rapid places that the surface
could not freeze. From such air-holes,
as they are called, steam arose that was like
the smoke of fires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that river?&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de Roaring Rifer, leddy,&rdquo; Stefan
informed her. &ldquo;Ve&rsquo;s only a little vays to go
now. Maybe five minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, as in a flash, all of her
vague and carking fears returned to the girl,
and her hand went to her breast. It was only
a little way now! And it was no dream&ndash;&ndash;no
figment of her imagination! The beginning
of the real adventure was at hand! Truth
flashed upon her. In a few moments she
would see for the first time the man she was
to marry. She blushed fiery red. Instinctively
she looked about her, like some wild
thing vainly seeking for a way to escape
impending peril. What would he be like?
What would he think of her? Oh! She now
knew that it had all been a frightful mistake!
Her limbs shook with a sudden bitter coldness
that had fallen upon her like one of the
masses that became displaced from the great
trees, and she could not keep her teeth from
chattering. Then, in her ears, began to boom
a strong continuous sound that was ominous,
threatening.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she stammered, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de noise of dem big Falls of Roaring
River,&rdquo; answered Stefan.</p>
<p>An instant later, Madge never knew why,
the dogs were snarling in a fight. In a moment
Stefan was among them, wielding his
short-handled and long-lashed whip. A trace
was broken. By the time the damage was
repaired and the dogs pacified some ten minutes
or more had been wasted. The man
looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got so much time left,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I got to hurry back for Mis&rsquo; Carew. Lucky
ve&rsquo;re most dere now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few seconds after they had started again
they came to an opening, towards which
Stefan pointed, and the girl&rsquo;s heart sank
within her.</p>
<p>She saw nothing of the distant falls surrounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
by a growth in which every twig
scintillated with the frost lavished by the
river&rsquo;s vapor. She never noticed the great
circular pool with its deep banks, or the wonderful
view, far across country, of mountains
washed in pale blues and lavenders, of the
sun-flooded bright expanse of open ground,
partly fenced in with axe-hewn rails. She
could only stare at a little shack, the smallest
she had seen in that country, and at the thread
of smoke coming from the length of stove-pipe
protruding from the ice-covered roof,
and to her it looked like the home of misery.</p>
<p>A few yards farther on the team stopped.
From here the hut could only be faintly distinguished
through a growth of birches and
firs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get off de toboggan now, leddy,&rdquo;
Stefan told her. &ldquo;I puts off your trunk too.
Hugo he come and get it. I call to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, speechless, amazed,
with fear causing a terrible throbbing in her
throat. She would have protested but could
not find her voice. As soon as Stefan had unlashed
the trunk and put it down on the frozen
ground he turned his team around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Hugo!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Oh! Hugo!
Here&rsquo;s de leddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant there was no reply, but while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Stefan yelled again she saw, through a small
opening in the interlaced branches, that the
door opened. A huge dog came out and
rolled in the snow, barking. The man waved
a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t vait a moment. Good-by, leddy, I
must go. You tell Hugo why I hurry so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had jumped on the toboggan and
he was already being borne away, swiftly, by
his team of wild shaggy brutes that seemed
never to have known a weary moment in their
lives. And she stood there, at the foot of a
great blasted pine, terror-stricken, wondering
what further torture of mind and body the
world had in store for her.</p>
<p>But for that hut the place was a frozen
desert, with no other sign of man. And she
was alone&ndash;&ndash;alone with him&ndash;&ndash;and the fierce-looking
dog was now running towards her.
She leaned back against the tree, feeling that
without some support she must collapse at its
foot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>When Gunpowder Speaks</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Hugo Ennis, a man well under thirty, tall
and spare of form, with the lithe and
active limbs that are capable of hard and prolonged
action, had stood for a time by the
tough door of his little shack. It was a single-roomed
affair, quite large enough for a lone
man, which he had carefully built of peeled
logs. Within it there was a bunk fixed
against the wall, upon which his heavy
blankets had been folded in a neat pile, for
he was a man of some order. Near the other
end there was a stove, a good one that could
keep the place warm and amply sufficed for
his simple cookery. The table was of axe-hewn
cedar planks and the two chairs had
been rustically designed of the same material.
Between the logs forming the walls the spaces
had been chinked with moss, covered with
blue clay taken from the river-bank, above
the falls. Strong pegs had been driven into
the heavy wood and from them hung traps
and a couple of guns, with spare snowshoes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and odd pieces of apparel. In a corner of
the room there were steel hand-drills, heavy
hammers, a pick and a shovel. Against the
walls he had built strong shelves that held
perhaps a score of books and a varied assortment
of groceries. More of these latter
articles had been placed on a swinging board
hung from the roof, out of reach of thieving
rodents.</p>
<p>He had been looking down, over the great
rocky ledge at one side of his shack, into the
big pool of the Roaring River, which at this
time was but a wild jam of huge slabs of ice
insecurely soldered together by snow and the
spray from the falls. Beneath that jumbled
mass he knew that the water was straining
and groaning and swirling until it found under
the thick ice the outlet that would lead it
towards the big lake to the eastward. Although
the middle of March was at hand
there was not the slightest sign of any breaking
up. He knew that it would take a long
time yet before the snows began to melt, the
ice to become thinner on the lakes and the
waters to rise, brown and turbid with the
earth torn from the banks and the sand ever
ground up in the rough play of turbulent
waters with rolling boulders.</p>
<p>Yet the coming of spring was not so very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
far off now and the days were growing longer.
It would take but a few weeks before the first
great wedges of flying geese would pass high
above him in their journey to the shallows of
the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, where they nested in myriads.
And then other birds would follow
until the smallest arrived, chirping with the
joy of the slumbering earth&rsquo;s awakening.</p>
<p>It was a glorious country, he truly believed.
The winter had been long but the hunting
and trapping had kept him busy enough.
The days had seemed too short to become
dreary and he had slept long during the
nights, seldom awakening at the rumblings
of the maddened pent-up waters or the sharp
explosions of great trees cracking in the fierce
cold. But he was glad of the prospect of renewed
hard work upon his claim, of promising
toil to expose further the great silver-bearing
veins of calcite that wound their way
through the harder rock. He knew that his
find was of the sort that had flooded the
Nipissing and the Gowganda countries with
eager searchers and delvers, and created villages
and even towns in a wilderness where
formerly the moose wandered in the great
hardwood swamps and the deer were often
chased by ravening packs of baying wolves.</p>
<p>His attention had reverted to the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
sharp-muzzled dog that had been crouching
at his feet, and he bent down and began to
pull out small porcupine quills that had become
fastened in the animal&rsquo;s nose and lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some day you&rsquo;ll learn enough to
let those varmints alone, Maigan, old boy,&rdquo;
he said, having become accustomed to long
conversations with his companion. &ldquo;I expect
you&rsquo;re pretty nearly as silly as a man. Experience
teaches you mighty little. Dogs and
men have been stung since the beginning of
the world, I expect, and keep on making the
same old mistakes. Hold hard, old fellow!
I know it hurts like the deuce but these things
have just got to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maigan is the name of the wolf, in some of
the Indian dialects, and Hugo&rsquo;s friend seemed
but little removed from a wolfish ancestry.
He evidently did his best to bear the punishment
bravely, for he never whimpered. At
times, however, he sought hard to pull his
muzzle away. Finally, to his great relief,
the last serrated quill was pulled out and he
jumped up, placing his paws on the man&rsquo;s
shoulders, perhaps to show he held no grudge.
After his master had petted him, an excitable
red squirrel required his immediate attention
and, as usual, led him to a fruitless chase. He
returned soon, scratching at the boards, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
his master let him in and closed the door. A
moment later the animal&rsquo;s sharp ears pricked
up; the wiry hair on his back rose and he
uttered a low growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Maigan!&rdquo; ordered his master.
&ldquo;Wonder who&rsquo;s coming? Maybe one of
Papineau&rsquo;s young ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire was getting low and he put a couple
of sticks of yellow birch in the stove. A few
seconds later he heard a shout that came from
behind the saplings which, in some places,
concealed the old tote-road from his view.
No one but Big Stefan could bellow out so
powerfully, to be sure. He opened the door
and Maigan leaped out. In more leisurely
fashion he followed and stopped, in astonishment,
as he caught sight of the dog-team flying
back towards Carcajou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer start!&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;First time I ever knew him not to stop for
a cup of tea and a talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought he saw something like a black
box through the branches and went up. It
must be something Stefan had left for him.
He walked up the path in leisurely fashion.
There was evidently no hurry. He was feeling
a little disappointment, for he had become
fond of Stefan during his long prospecting
trip and would have been glad of a chat to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the invariable accompaniment of the hospitable
tea-kettle. He had just made some pretty
good biscuits, too. It was a pity the Swede
wouldn&rsquo;t share them with him. He reached
the black box which, to his surprise, turned
out to be a small corded trunk lying on the
hard dry snow, with a cheap leather bag on
top of it. He looked about him in wonder
and stopped, suddenly, staring in astonishment
at the form of a woman, shapeless in
great ill-fitting garments too big for her. She
was leaning back against the great bare trunk
of the old blasted pine and the dog was skulking
around her, curiously. Then he hurried
towards her, calling out a word of warning to
Maigan, who seemed to realize that this was
no enemy. And as he came the woman,
deathly pale, seemed to look upon him as if
he had been some terrifying ghost. She put
out her hands, just a little, as if seeking to
protect herself from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&ndash;&ndash;are you Hugo Ennis?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every one
knows me around here. What&ndash;&ndash;what can
I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&ndash;&ndash;my name is Madge Nelson,&rdquo; she
Stammered. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m Madge Nelson from&ndash;&ndash;from
New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Nelson?&rdquo; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
quietly, touching his fur cap. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ve had a mighty cold ride.
What&rsquo;s happened to Stefan to make him go
back? Lost something on the road, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m the only lost thing
around here,&rdquo; she said, seeking to hold back
the tears that were beginning to well up in her
eyes. &ldquo;Oh! I think&ndash;&ndash;I think I&rsquo;m becoming
mad!&rdquo; she suddenly cried out, bitterly. &ldquo;Is&ndash;&ndash;is
that your&ndash;&ndash;your house, the&ndash;&ndash;the residence
you spoke of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&ndash;&ndash;the residence!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And
I spoke of it, did I? Well, I suppose that
anything with a roof on it is a residence, if
you come to that. Yes, that&rsquo;s it, the little
shack among the birches, and you&rsquo;d better
come in till Stefan gets back, for it&rsquo;s mighty
cold here and&ndash;&ndash;and if you&rsquo;re from New
York you&rsquo;re not used to this sort of thing.
It&rsquo;s the best I can offer you, but I really never
thought it worth talking about. It&rsquo;s the
slight improvement on a dog-kennel that we
folks have to be contented with, in these parts.
Come right in; you look half frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and that is the sort of place you&rsquo;ve
brought me to?&rdquo; she cried, her eyes now
flashing at him in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to me that it&rsquo;s Stefan that
brought you,&rdquo; he replied, rather abashed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s only a mean quibble,&rdquo; she
retorted, hotly. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and where&rsquo;s the
town&ndash;&ndash;or the village&ndash;&ndash;and the other people,
the friends who were to greet me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was beginning to feel
rather provoked at her questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest settlers are a short mile away,&ndash;&ndash;the
Papineaus, very decent French Canadians.
Tom Carew&rsquo;s shack you must have
passed on your way here. The only village,
of course, is Carcajou, and that&rsquo;s twelve long
miles away. But Mrs. Papineau is a real good
old soul, if that&rsquo;s where you expect to stop.
A dozen kids about the place but they&rsquo;re jolly
little beggars. Her husband&rsquo;s trapping now,
I believe, but of course I&rsquo;ll take you up
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this she seemed to feel somewhat relieved.
It was evident that she was in no
great peril. Yet she looked again at his shack,
with her lower lip in the bite of her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you didn&rsquo;t really believe I&rsquo;d
come,&rdquo; she said, her mouth quivering. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you
were just making fun of me, I see, with&ndash;&ndash;with
that residence and&ndash;&ndash;and the ladies
who were ready to welcome me. Where are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ennis was scratching his head, or the cap
over it, as he stared again at her. He realized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
that some amazing, terrible mistake must have
been made, as he thought&ndash;&ndash;or that this girl
must be the victim of some dreadful misunderstanding,
if not of a foul plot. He began
to pity her. She looked so weak, so helpless,
in spite of the anger she had shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&ndash;&ndash;there are no ladies,&rdquo; he said,
lamely, &ldquo;except Mrs. Papineau and Mrs.
Carew. They&rsquo;re first-rate women, both of
&rsquo;em. And of course Mrs. Papineau is your
only resource till to-morrow, unless Stefan is
coming back for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I said nothing
about going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awkward,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
tell me all about this thing later on, won&rsquo;t
you, because I might be able to help you out.
But you&rsquo;ll be all right for a while, anyway.
I&rsquo;ll take you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please start at once,&rdquo; she cried, desperately.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t stay here for another
instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can be ready in a very few minutes,&rdquo;
he told her, quietly. &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you please
come over to the shack. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re beginning
to feel the cold. You&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re shivering
and&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m afraid you look rather
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had insisted on Stefan&rsquo;s taking back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
some of the things she had borrowed from his
wife, and had been standing there in rather
inadequate clothing. Ennis pulled off his
heavy mackinaw jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must put this on at once,&rdquo; he told her,
gently enough, &ldquo;and come right over there
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge shrank from him, as if she feared to
be touched by him, and yet there was something
in the frank way in which he addressed
her, perhaps also in the clear and unembarrassed
look of his eyes, that was gradually
allaying her fears and the fierce repulsion of
the first few moments. Finally, chilled as
she was to the very marrow of her bones, she
consented to accept his offer and submitted to
his helping her on with the coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good fire in the shack just now,&rdquo;
he told her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary for
you to get thoroughly warmed up before you
start off again. A cup of hot tea would do
you a lot of good, too, after that long ride on
Stefan&rsquo;s toboggan. It&rsquo;s no joke of an undertaking
for a&ndash;&ndash;a young lady who isn&rsquo;t used to
such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge was still hesitating. The suffering
look that had come into her eyes moved the
young man to greater pity for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I give you my word you have absolutely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
nothing to fear,&rdquo; he assured her, whereupon
she followed him meekly, feeling very
faint now. She half feared that she might
have to clutch at his sleeve, if her footsteps
failed her, for she felt that at any moment she
might stagger and fall. She gasped again as
she looked at the shack they were nearing,
but, as she beheld the scenery of the great
pool, something in it that was very grand and
beautiful appealed to her for an instant. Yet
she felt crushed by it, as if she had been some
infinitesimal insect beside that stupendous
crashing of waters, before the great ledges
whose tops were hirsute with gnarled firs and
twisted jack-pines. She stopped for a moment,
perhaps owing to her weakness, or possibly
because of awe at the majesty of the
scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just love it,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It grows
more utterly splendid every time one looks
at it. See that mass of rubbish on the top of
that great hemlock. It is the nest of a pair of
ospreys. They come every year, I&rsquo;ve been
told. Last summer I saw them circling high
up in the heavens, at times, and they would
utter shrill cries as if they had been the guardians
of the falls and warned me off. But we
had better hurry in, Miss&ndash;&ndash;Miss Nelson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant she had listened, wondering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
This man did not speak like a common toiler
of city or country. His manner, somewhat
distant, in no way reminded her of the coarse
familiarity she had often been subjected to in
shop and factory. But a moment later such
thoughts passed off and she followed him,
resentfully, feeling that she was to some extent
forced to submit to his will. As Ennis pulled
the door open and held it for her to walk in,
he looked at her keenly. He had suddenly
remembered hearing that exposure to intense
cold had sometimes actually disturbed the
brains of people; that it had brought on some
form of insanity. He wondered whether,
perhaps, this had been the case with her? It
was with greater concern and sympathy that
he felt he must treat her. The vagaries of
her language, the reproaches she seemed to
think he deserved, were doubtless things she
was not responsible for. And then she looked
so weary, so overcome, so ready to collapse
with faintness!</p>
<p>Madge entered the shack. It had been
swept, neatly enough, and everything was arranged
in orderly fashion, except some loose
things piled up in one corner, out of the way.
The little stove was glowing, and the draft
was purring softly. The girl pulled off her
mitts and held her reddened hands to it while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Hugo brought her one of his rough chairs.
Then, without a word, he placed a kettle on
the fire, after which he brought out a white
enameled cup and a small pan containing
some of his biscuits. After cogitating for a
moment he also placed on the table a tin of
sardines.</p>
<p>Madge had dropped upon the chair, and
began to feel more unutterably weary than
ever. The heat, close to the stove, became too
great for her and she moved her chair to the
table, a couple of feet away, and placed her
arms upon it. Her head fell forward on them,
and when, a few moments later, Hugo spoke
to her and she lifted up her face he was dismayed
as he saw the tears that were running
down her cheeks. The man could only bite
his lips. What consolation or comfort could
he proffer? It was perhaps better to appear
to take no notice of her distress. But the
weeping of genuine suffering and unhappiness
is a hard thing for a youth to see. The impulse
had come to him to cry out for information,
to beg her to explain, to question her, to
get at the bottom of all this mystery. He was
held from this by the renewed thought that
her mind was probably affected. He might
further irritate her or cause her still deeper
chagrin. Even if he erred in this idea the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
moment was probably ill-chosen. It would
be better for her to tell her tale before others
also. He would wait until after he had taken
her over to Papineau&rsquo;s. She looked so harmless
and weak that the idea that she might
prove dangerous never entered his head.</p>
<p>The kettle began to sing and a moment later
the water was boiling hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t offer you much of a meal, Miss
Nelson,&rdquo; he said, seeking to make his voice
as pleasant as possible. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve probably
never tried sour-dough biscuits. Mrs. Papineau&rsquo;s
are better, but you may be able to manage
one or two of these. That good woman&rsquo;s
a mighty good cook, as cooking goes in these
parts. Here&rsquo;s a can of condensed milk;
won&rsquo;t you help yourself? You must really
try to eat something. Do you think you could
try a little cold corned beef? I have some
canned stuff that&rsquo;s not half bad. Or it would
take but a moment to broil you a partridge
I got yesterday. But I&rsquo;ll open these sardines
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to work with a large jack-knife,
but she thanked him, briefly, in a low voice,
and refused to accept anything but the tea
and a bit of the biscuit. She wondered why
he didn&rsquo;t also sit down to eat. It bothered her
to see him hovering over her like some sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
waiter. He was probably staring at her, when
her head was turned, and enjoying his dastardly
jest. When she thought of those letters
she had received and of all they contained of
lies, of unimaginable falsehoods, the man began
again to repel her like some venomous
reptile. She could have shrieked out as he
came near. What an actor he was! What
control he held over voice and face as he pretended
to know nothing about her. His effort
had been evident, from the very first instant
they had met, to disclaim the slightest knowledge
of her or of the reasons for her coming!
She felt utterly bewildered. He answered to
that name of Hugo Ennis and had admitted
that this was Roaring River, as Stefan had
also told her. Moreover, the big Swede knew
perfectly well that she was coming and expected.
In word, in action, in every move of
his, this man was lying, stupidly, coarsely,
with features indifferent or pretending concern.
It was unbearable.</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him again, swiftly
but haggardly. She would never have conceived
the possibility of a man dissembling so,
in letters first and lying again in every move
and every tone of his voice. How could
he keep it so tranquil and unmoved? Yet
when he came near her again, insisting on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
filling her cup once more, she seemed for an
instant to forget the rough clothes, the mean
little shack, the strange conspiracy of which
she was the victim and which had aroused her
passionate protests. Over the first mouthfuls
of hot tea she had nearly choked, but she had
found the warm brew welcome and its odor
grateful and pleasant. It mingled in some
way with the scent of the balsam boughs with
which the bunk was covered and over which
the blankets reposed. She had experienced
something like this feeling in the hospital, the
first time she had been an inmate of it. It
was as if again she had been very ill and
awakened in an unfamiliar and bewildering
place. The great weakness she experienced
was something like that which she had felt in
the great ward, where the rows of beds
stretched before her and at either side. Some
were screened, she remembered, and held the
poor creatures for whom there was no longer
any hope. It was as if now a turn of her head
could have revealed a white-capped nurse
moving silently, deftly bringing comfort.
Her hands had become quite warm again;
she passed one of them over her brow as if
this motion might have dispelled some strange
vision.</p>
<p>The big dog, Maigan, came to her and laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
his sharp head and pointed cold muzzle on
her lap, and she stroked it, mechanically.
This, at any rate, was something genuine and
friendly that had come to her. Again and
again she passed her hand over the rough neck
and head. At this, however, something
within her broke again and her head fell once
more on her arms as she sobbed,&ndash;&ndash;sobbed as
if her heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid you must have gone
through a good deal of&ndash;&ndash;of unhappiness,&rdquo;
faltered the man, anxiously. &ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s really
too bad and I&rsquo;d give anything if I could....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl lifted up her hand, as if to
check his words. What right had a man who
was guilty of such conduct to begin proffering
a repentance that was unavailing, nay, contemptible?
Did he think that a few halting
words could atone for his cruelty, could dispel
the evil he had wrought?</p>
<p>At this he kept silent again, during long
minutes, appalled as men always are at the
first sight of a woman&rsquo;s tears. He felt utterly
helpless to console or advise, and was becoming
more and more bewildered at this interruption
of his lonely and quiet life. Since she
didn&rsquo;t want him to speak he would hold his
tongue. If she hadn&rsquo;t looked so dreadfully
unhappy he would have deemed her an infernal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
nuisance and hurried her departure.
But in this case how could a fellow be brutal
to a poor thing that wailed like a child, that
seemed weaker than one and more in need of
gentle care?</p>
<p>Soon she rose from the table, determinedly,
with some of her energy renewed by the food
and hot drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, let us go now,&rdquo; she told him,
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m entirely at your service,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I think you had better let me lend you a
cap. That thing you have on your head can
hardly keep your ears from freezing. I have
a new one that&rsquo;s never been worn. Wait a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His search was soon rewarded. She had
kept on but her inefficient little New York
hat with its faded buds and wrinkled leaves
and now tried to remove it. Her hands
trembled, however, and the strain of travel
had been hard. All at once, as she pulled
away, her coiled hair escaped all restraint of
pins and fell down upon her shoulders, in a
great waving chestnut mass. At this Hugo
opened the door and ran out, returning a
couple of minutes later with the bag that had
been left on the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I expect you need some of your
things,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>She looked at him with some gratitude.
Most men wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of it. Nodding
her thanks she opened the thing and was
compelled to pull out various articles before
she could get at her comb and brush. Her
movements were still very nervous. It was
embarrassing to be there before that man
with one&rsquo;s hair all undone and awry. Something
fell from her hand, striking the edge of
the table and toppling to the floor. There
was a deafening explosion and the shack was
full of the dense smoke of black powder.
When Madge recovered from her terror the
young man, looking very pale, had bent down
and picked up the fallen weapon. For a
moment she thought there was a strange
look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&ndash;&ndash;if you were to hit a man with that
thing he&rsquo;d get real mad,&rdquo; he said, repeating
an age-worn joke. &ldquo;At any rate I&rsquo;m glad
you were not hurt. Rather unexpected,
wasn&rsquo;t it? I really think you&rsquo;d better let me
take the other shells out. It&rsquo;s a nasty little
cheap weapon and, I should judge, quite an
unsafe bit of hardware for a lady to handle.
Whoever gave you that thing ought to be
spanked. But&ndash;&ndash;but, then, of course you
didn&rsquo;t know it was loaded.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I did know it was loaded!&rdquo; cried
Madge. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I had the man load it for me!
I&ndash;&ndash;I thought it might protect me from insult,
perhaps, or&ndash;&ndash;or let me take matters in my
own hands, if need be. I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t know
what sort of place I would be coming to or&ndash;&ndash;or
what sort of man would&ndash;&ndash;would receive
me! I&ndash;&ndash;I felt safer with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maigan was still ferreting out corners of
the room, having leaped up at the shot as if
the idea had come to him that some rat or
chipmunk must lie dead somewhere. There
nearly always was something to pick up when
his master fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, boy!&rdquo; ordered the latter. &ldquo;I
think we&rsquo;d better count that as a miss. I&rsquo;ll
wait outside until you&rsquo;ve fixed yourself up,
Miss Nelson, and are ready to go. I&rsquo;ll have
to hitch up Maigan first. As soon as you come
out I&rsquo;ll wrap you in my blankets; you&rsquo;ll be
quite comfortable. We haven&rsquo;t very far to
go, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;it won&rsquo;t take me a
minute,&rdquo; she answered, without looking at
him.</p>
<p>She had discovered in a corner of the shack
a bit of looking-glass he used to shave by, and
stood before it, never noticing that he made a
rather long job of drawing on his heavy fur
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
coat. He went out with his dog and got the
sled ready, with a wry look upon his face.
Then, as there was nothing more to do, he sat
down upon the rough bench that stood near
the door. He winced and made a grimace as
his hand went up to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little fool,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;She
seems to have been loaded for bear. Glad it
was a thirty-two instead of a forty-five Colt.
I didn&rsquo;t think it was anything, just a bad
scratch, after the first sting of it, but it feels
like fire and brimstone now. It&rsquo;s an infernal
nuisance. Good Lord! Suppose she&rsquo;d
plugged herself instead of me. That would
have been a fix for fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea evidently horrified him. He had
a vision of blood and tears and screams, of
having to rush off to Carcajou to telegraph
for the nearest doctor. Perhaps people would
even have suspected him. He saw Madge
with her big dark-rimmed eyes and that perfectly
wonderful hair, lying dead or dying on
the floor of his shack. It was utterly gruesome,
unspeakable, and a strong shiver passed
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wonder who the deuce she was
going to shoot with that thing?&rdquo; he finally
asked himself. &ldquo;Oh, she must be crazy, the
poor little thing! It&rsquo;s really too bad!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>He then thought of what a fool he had been
to give her back that gimcrack pistol. She
probably had more shells. He must contrive
to get them away from her. There was no
saying what an insane person might do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Stefan would turn up soon,&rdquo; he
cogitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a lot to find out what
he knows about her. It was mighty funny his
never stopping here for a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Deeper in the Wilderness</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Within the shack Madge was now ready
to start. Hugo&rsquo;s big woolen cap was
pulled down well over her ears and she again
wore a coat much too large for her, a thing
which, in other days long gone, might have
made her laugh.</p>
<p>As she moved to the door she hesitated.
Where was she going to? What object was
there in moving there or anywhere else? The
wild dream that had come upon her in the
big city was dispelled and nothing on earth
remained but the end that must come in some
way or other. Of course she had no desire to
remain in this shack, but neither had she any
desire for anything else. What was the use
of anything she might do? By this time she
was stranded high and dry among breakers
innumerable, with never the slightest outlook
towards safety. The few dollars in her pockets
offered no possibility of return. This man
might give her enough to get back, if she
asked him. It was the least he could do. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
she would rather have torn out her tongue
than ask him for money. And it would only
be going back to that dreadful city in which
she had suffered so much. No, it was unthinkable!
Better by far for her to lie down
somewhere in that great forest and die. And
now she was about to see more strangers and
remain over night in new surroundings.
Where would she drift to after that?</p>
<p>She made a gesture of despair. Her down-hanging
arms straightened rigidly at her side,
with the fists clenched as when one seeks to be
brave in the face of impending agony. Her
head was thrown back and her eyes nearly
closed. In that position she remained for a
moment, her brain whirling, her head on fire
with a burning pain. Then the tension relaxed
a little and she cast another look about
her, without seeing anything, after which she
pushed the door open and stepped out upon
the crunching snow.</p>
<p>Hugo rose at once, albeit somewhat stiffly,
and spoke to the dog who stood up, with head
turned to watch the proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d better take the trunk on
this trip,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It would make a
rather heavy load for just one dog. We&rsquo;ll
take your bag, of course, and I can bring the
trunk over to-morrow morning. It will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
perfectly safe there by the road. We haven&rsquo;t
any thieves in this country, that I know of.
Now will you please sit down there, in the
middle. Maigan will pull you all right. I&rsquo;ll
get the blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;couldn&rsquo;t I walk? You said it was
only a mile. I&ndash;&ndash;I think I could manage
that,&rdquo; ventured Madge, dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you could,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re quite played out. In some
places the snow is bound to be soft. I could
give you a pair of snowshoes but you wouldn&rsquo;t
know how to use them and they&rsquo;d tire you to
death. You&rsquo;ve already had a pretty hard
day, I know. Maigan won&rsquo;t mind it in the
least. He&rsquo;d take the trunk, too, readily
enough, but that would make slow going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed. What did she care? What
difference could it make? He wrapped the
blankets over her, after she had sat down on
an old wolfskin he had covered the sled with.
After this he took a long line attached to the
toboggan and passed it over his right shoulder,
pulling at the side of the dog, who toiled on
briskly. When they reached the tote-road it
seemed rougher than ever and the country
wilder. To her right Madge could see the
river that was nothing but a winding jumble
of snow-capped rocks and grinding ice, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
here and there patches of inky-looking water,
where the ice-crust had split asunder. Also
she dully noted places where the water seemed
to froth up over the surface, boiling in great
suds from which rose, straight up in the still
air, a cloud of heavy gray vapor. The cold
felt even more intense than earlier in the day.
It impressed the girl as if some tremendous
force were bearing down mightily upon the
world and holding it in thrall. With the lowering
of the sun the shadows had grown
longer. After a time the slight sound of the
man&rsquo;s snowshoes over the crackling snow, of
the scraping toboggan, of the panting dog,
began to seem to Madge like some sort of
desecration of a stillness in which man was
nothing and only an eternal and vengeful
power reigned supreme. In spite of the
patches of sunlight filtering down through
branches or glaring upon the river there was
now something dismal in all this, and she began
to feel the cold again, penetrating, relentless,
evil in its might.</p>
<p>They had gone about half way when, on the
top of a slight rise, both dog and man stopped
for a moment&rsquo;s rest. The latter looked quite
exhausted. His face was set hard, in an expression
she could not fathom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I think I could walk,&rdquo; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
girl again. &ldquo;There&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s no reason you
should work so hard for me. And&ndash;&ndash;and you
look terribly tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he disclaimed, hastily. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I
could pull you all by myself if&ndash;&ndash;well, it&rsquo;s
only a short distance away now, and Maigan
is doing nearly all the work, anyway. I&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t think anything I can do for you can
quite make up for all that you seem to have
gone through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her, very gravely, as he sat
down upon a fallen log, close at hand, after
clearing off some snow with a sweep of his
mitt. There was something very sad, she
thought, an expression of pain upon his face
which she noted and which led her into a very
natural error. She was compelled to consider
these things as evidences of regret, of a
conscience that was beginning to irk him
badly. Her head bent down till she was staring
into her lap; she felt that tears were once
more dangerously near.</p>
<p>No thought came to her of appealing to
this man, of suing for pity and charity, but
she began to speak, the words coming from a
full heart that gave her pain were spoken in
low tones, nearly as if she had been talking to
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m thinking of the boys who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
stoning the frog,&rdquo; she began, haltingly. &ldquo;You
remember. It was fun for them but death to
the frog. I&ndash;&ndash;I think a good many things
work that way in the world, don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t
you, Mr. Ennis? You&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t really
look like&ndash;&ndash;like a very bad man. If&ndash;&ndash;if you
had a sister or mother you&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d probably
be kind to them. What&ndash;&ndash;what do you
think of it yourself, honestly? A&ndash;&ndash;a girl,
who&rsquo;s a fool, of course, but after all just a girl,
is dying of loneliness and misery in a big city.
She&ndash;&ndash;she can&rsquo;t stand it any more, not&ndash;&ndash;not
for another day. And then she finds that
paper and like&ndash;&ndash;like an utter fool she answers
that advertisement. It&ndash;&ndash;it looked like a bare
chance of&ndash;&ndash;of being able to keep body and
soul together, and&ndash;&ndash;and remain honest and
decent, which&ndash;&ndash;which is a hard enough thing
for a girl to do, in&ndash;&ndash;in some places. And
then the man answers back. She&ndash;&ndash;I never
expected he would, but he did, and he offered
all sorts of wonderful things that&ndash;&ndash;that
looked like heaven itself to&ndash;&ndash;to a hungry
failure of a girl to whom life had become too
heavy a burden to bear. And&ndash;&ndash;and so she
answers that letter and&ndash;&ndash;and tries to tell the
truth about herself, and says that&ndash;&ndash;that she is
prepared to carry out her part of the bargain
if&ndash;&ndash;if the man has spoken truly of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
himself&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;if he can respect her&ndash;&ndash;treat her like
a woman who&ndash;&ndash;who is ready to do her best
to&ndash;&ndash;to deserve a little kindness and consideration.
And he tells her again to come&ndash;&ndash;to
come as soon as possible, and&ndash;&ndash;and there was
nothing to detain her for a moment. The city
had been too cruel&ndash;&ndash;too utterly cruel. And
then she comes here and finds that&ndash;&ndash;that it
was all lies&ndash;&ndash;wicked lies&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s
the only word I can use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugo was staring at her, open-mouthed,
but before he could utter a word she began
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man had never meant it, of course&ndash;&ndash;he
wasn&rsquo;t awaiting her at all, as he had promised&ndash;&ndash;and
when she finally comes to him he
speaks coldly, cynically, denying his words,
pretending he knows nothing. It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a
rather clumsy way of getting out of it, seems
to me. Anyway he saw that his joke had been
carried too far. It&ndash;&ndash;it hasn&rsquo;t proved such a
very good one, has it? It&ndash;&ndash;it has turned out
to be pretty poor fun. I&ndash;&ndash;I dare say I deserve
it all. It&ndash;&ndash;it was awful folly on my
part, I see it now, and&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m ashamed,
dreadfully ashamed&ndash;&ndash;I feel the redness
mounting to&ndash;&ndash;to the very roots of my hair&ndash;&ndash;and
it overwhelms me. Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you
feel something of&ndash;&ndash;of the same sort, or&ndash;&ndash;or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
do you still think the joke was a good
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had grown rather excited and it was
quite true that a deep blush was now mantling
her face. In her halting speech&ndash;&ndash;in the
words that had come slowly at first, and then
had flowed more rapidly, there had been
wounded pride beside the deep resentment
and the pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ndash;&ndash;do you really believe such a
thing?&rdquo; answered the man, wincing again.
&ldquo;You speak of something that is an abomination,
that would stink in a decent man&rsquo;s nostrils.
And&ndash;&ndash;and you speak of shame! Do
you think such a word could express all that
a man would be overwhelmed with if he had
done such a thing? Great Heavens! Miss
Nelson, a man having once committed such a
crime would be humiliated for the rest of his
life, it seems to me. It would be an unpardonable
sin for which there could be no forgiveness,
none surely on the part of the
woman, and none that the man could ever
grant himself. It&ndash;&ndash;it surely isn&rsquo;t possible
that any such thing has occurred, that any
man could so lower himself beneath all the
dirt that his feet have ever trodden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke strongly, his face now also high
in color, his voice tremulous and indignant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
his hard right fist clenched till the arm vibrated
with the strain.</p>
<p>Madge looked at him again. For a moment
his tone had been convincing and she
had nearly believed that he spoke the truth.
But the evidence against him was too strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&ndash;&ndash;that big Stefan, your friend, the
man who says that you saved his life, knew
that I was coming,&rdquo; she faltered, her voice
shaking while her body felt limp with the
infinite discouragement that had returned to
her in full. &ldquo;He brought you my message, at
least he told me so. What&ndash;&ndash;what is the use
of my saying anything more? I&ndash;&ndash;I think
we might as well be going on, if&ndash;&ndash;if you and
your dog are rested. He&ndash;&ndash;he looks like a
decent fellow, Maigan does. There are things
a dog wouldn&rsquo;t do, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Nelson, as God is my judge, I&rsquo;m
guiltless in this matter,&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s voice rang
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Maigan, mush on!&rdquo; he called, and
leaned forward on the rope, passed over one
shoulder. Her last words had brought a
moment of anger and indignation. Save for
the few words he had uttered he felt it useless
to protest his innocence, and the notion of her
insanity returned to him, strongly. But those
were strange things she had said about Stefan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and that message. As soon as possible he
would go over to Carcajou and interview his
friend the Swede. The girl&rsquo;s disordered
mind must have distorted something that he
said. He began to wonder whether there
was any truth at all about her story, whether
she really came from New York, whether she
was not some poor creature escaped from
some place for the care of the insane. But
then how had she got hold of his name and
how had she ever heard of Roaring River?
The more he puzzled over these problems the
more tangled they appeared to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say I&rsquo;ll find out about it soon
enough,&rdquo; he told himself, impatiently, for the
pain he suffered began to grow worse with
every step, and an unaccountable weariness
had come over him. That thing on his shoulder
must be a mere scratch, he tried to persuade
himself, in spite of the sharp pangs it
gave him. Manlike he grew more obstinate
as his strength began to fail, and pulled
harder, with the sweat now running down his
clammy forehead and freezing on his face.</p>
<p>Maigan, also, was bending hard to his task,
and they went along steadily and rapidly.
The toboggan was crackling and slithering
over the snow upon which the dark indigo
shadows were throwing uncanny designs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
The track was smooth and level now and the
dog could manage very well alone, so that
Hugo pulled no longer. Once, as he chanced
to stumble, the girl thought she heard a groan
from him. She began to wish that she had
been able to believe him, but it was utterly
impossible, although she suddenly found it in
her heart to pity him, to extenuate the abomination
of his conduct. Why that last sacrilegious
lie he had uttered? The man was suffering;
it looked as if the iron were entering
his soul. Oh! the pity of it! If he had only
acknowledged his offence and begged her
pardon she might perhaps have forgiven. A
moment later, however, the grim outlook before
her presented itself again. There were
two things for her to choose from; one was
that fitly named Roaring River along whose
bank the road wound its snaky trail and the
other consisted in the cheap little pistol in her
bag. Well, there might be comfort after all
in this wild land, upon the scented fallen
needles of the pines or under that pure white
ice. Her features, which for a moment had
become stony and hard, now softened again.
It was best to endeavor to harbor no more
thoughts of contempt and hatred when one&rsquo;s
own soul might soon be suing for forgiveness.</p>
<p>They topped another rise of ground beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
which there was a hollow, a tiny valley nestled
among great firs and poplars and birches. In
the middle of it Madge saw another and much
larger shack. It might really have been
called a house, but for its being made of logs.
A film of smoke was rising straight up in the
still air, from a chimney built of rough stones,
and some dogs began to bark loudly. A
woman came out, with a child hanging to her
skirts, and shaded her eyes with her hand
while she scolded the animals, who slunk
away slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bonjour</i>,&rdquo; she called out, cheerfully.
&ldquo;Ah! It is Monsieur Hugo! How you do,
sare? Glad for see you! Come along quick.
It ees cole again, terrible cole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second she stared at the young woman
on the toboggan, but her civility came at once
uppermost and she smiled pleasantly, and
rushed up to help Madge arise, brushing off
some of the snow that had fallen on her from
the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside quick. I have it good hot in
de house. You all perished wid dat cole,
Mees. Now you get varm again and I make
tea <i>tout de suite</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had seized Madge&rsquo;s hands in her own
big and capable ones, with the never-failing
hospitality and friendliness of the wilderness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
and led her indoors at once. Hugo let Maigan
loose, with a word of warning, for the other
dogs had begun to circle about him jealously,
and growled a little, probably for the sake of
form, for they took good care to keep out of
reach of his long fangs. They had tried him
once before and knew that he was their master.
Hugo, thankful that the journey was
ended, took up the girl&rsquo;s bag and followed
her into the house, after he had taken off his
snowshoes, a job he accomplished with some
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Papineau,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;this young
lady came over to my place, a couple of hours
ago, and&ndash;&ndash;and there&rsquo;s been some&ndash;&ndash;some
mistake. She thought there was a village
here, I believe. She only expects to remain
with you till to-morrow, I think, and till then
I will be ever so grateful if you will make her
as comfortable as possible. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s
dreadfully tired and cold. I expect to return
in the morning to take her back to Carcajou,
unless&ndash;&ndash;unless she would prefer to rest a day
or two here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ver &rsquo;appy to see de lady,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Papineau, heartily. &ldquo;Tak&rsquo; off you coat,
Monsieur Hugo, an&rsquo; sit here by de fire. Hey!
Baptiste, you bring more big piece of birch.
Colette, put kettle on for bile water qvick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Tak&rsquo; dis seat, lady. I pull off dem blanket.
You no need dem more. Turriple cole now.
Las&rsquo; night we &rsquo;ear de wolfs &rsquo;untin&rsquo; along dem
&rsquo;ardwood ridges, back of de river; it ees always
sign of big cole. And de river she crack
awful, and de trees dey split like guns shoot.
Glad you come an&rsquo; get varm, Mees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge looked about her, after she had
smiled at the woman in thanks. For the
second time that day she had entered a home
of kindly and well-disposed people that
seemed to be built of an altogether different
clay from that which composed the folk of
the big city. In Stefan&rsquo;s home the atmosphere
had been gentle, one of earnest, quiet toil,
with the simple accompaniment of a kindly
religious belief according to the Lutheran
persuasion. In the dwelling she had now
entered, of fervent French Canadians, she
noted the vivid chromo of a departed pope
facing the still gaudier representation of the
British Royal family, if the printed legend
could be believed. They were shown in all
the colors of the rainbow, as were also some
saints whose glaring portraits hung on either
side of the door, surmounted by dried palms
reminiscent of Easter festivals. There seemed
to be any number of children, from an infant
lying in a homemade cradle of boards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
one of which displayed an advertisement of
soap, to a bashful youth who looked at Hugo
as if he worshipped him and a freckled,
gawky and friendly-faced girl of fifteen who
stood around, evidently delighted to see
people and anxious to be civil to them.</p>
<p>And this welcome she had received seemed
to be characteristic of all these folks living in
the back of beyond. Everywhere she had met
friendliness; people had seemed actually
eager to help; they smiled as if life had been
a thing of joy in which the good things must
be distributed far and near and enjoyed by all.
They seemed ready to share their possessions
with strangers that chanced within their gates.
It was a spirit intensely restful, consoling,
bringing peace to one&rsquo;s heart. It gave the girl
a brief vision of something that was heavenly.
She felt that she could so easily have made
her home in this amazing region that opened
its arms and actually welcomed new faces.
But the thought came to her that she had only
been vouchsafed a fleeting glance at it and to
gaze, as Moses did of old, upon a Promised
Land she could never really enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no need for to h&rsquo;ask, Monsieur
Hugo,&rdquo; Madge heard the woman saying.
&ldquo;Ve do h&rsquo;all ve can, sure! It ees a gladness
to see de yong lady an&rsquo; heem pretty face, all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>

Hugo, you stop for to h&rsquo;eat a bite vid us.
Ve haf&rsquo; in de shed still one big quarter from
de <i>orignal</i>, de beeg mose vat my man he shoot
two veeks ago. Und dere pleanty <i>patates</i>,
pleanty pork, all you vant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you ever so much, I&ndash;&ndash;I think
I&rsquo;d better be going. It will be dark pretty
soon. I know perfectly well that you will
take excellent care of Miss Nelson and so I
think I&rsquo;ll say good-by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the children trooped around him,
disappointed, and Mrs. Papineau came
nearer, eying him curiously. Suddenly her
keen eyes caught something and she pointed
with a finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat de mattaire vid you h&rsquo;arm?&rdquo; she
asked, excitedly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow you get &rsquo;urted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That! That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he answered,
drawing back. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t worth bothering
about. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no be one beeg fool, Monsieur
Hugo!&rdquo; she ordered him, masterfully. &ldquo;Now
you sit down an&rsquo; let me look heem arm right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
avay quick. Ven de cole strike heem he get
bad sure, dat h&rsquo;arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his objections she laid violent
hands on him, insisting on pulling off his coat,
whereupon a dark patch had spread. She
also drew off the heavy sweater he wore
underneath it, which was stained even more
deeply. When she sought to roll up the sleeve
of his flannel shirt it would not go up high
enough, but the remedy was close at hand, in
the form of a pair of scissors, and she swiftly
ripped up a seam. On the outer part of the
shoulder she revealed a rather large and
jagged wound that was all smeared with
blood, which still oozed from it slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who go an&rsquo; shoot you?&rdquo; she asked angrily.
&ldquo;I see de &rsquo;ole in de coat an&rsquo; de sweater. I
know some one shoot. Vat for he shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was just a silly little accident
with a pistol,&rdquo; he acknowledged with much
embarrassment. &ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it won&rsquo;t be anything
after it&rsquo;s washed off. It feels all right enough
and I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t bother about it.
I&rsquo;ll attend to it after I get home. It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
stopped hurting now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was compelled to submit to the
washing of his injury and to the application
of some sort of a dressing which Mrs. Papineau
appeared to put on rather skilfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Wounds of all sorts are but too common in the
wilderness, unfortunately, and doctors few
and far between. The children had crowded
around him, looking in awe, and their mother
kept ordering them away. Madge had risen
from her seat and looked at the injury, horrified
and trembling. The man had never said
a word when that bullet had found its billet
in his shoulder, and yet it must have hurt him
dreadfully. He&ndash;&ndash;he might have been killed,
owing to her clumsiness, she reflected in consternation.
And now he said nothing to explain
how it had happened&ndash;&ndash;he actually
seemed to be trying to shield her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry,&rdquo; said the girl,
impulsively. &ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it was all my fault, because
I let the revolver fall and it went off.
But I didn&rsquo;t know he was hurt. He never
told me, and he insisted on pulling at that
sled, with his dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was just a little accident,&rdquo; admitted
Hugo, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re making altogether too
much fuss about it. It really doesn&rsquo;t amount
to anything, Miss Nelson, and it feels splendidly
now. I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged to you,
Mrs. Papineau. And so I&rsquo;ll say good-night.
I hope you&rsquo;ll rest well, Miss Nelson. I&rsquo;ll be
here in good time to-morrow, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands with the housewife, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
took care to wipe her own upon her apron in
preparation for the ceremony. To the children
he bade a comprehensive farewell, after
which he turned again to Madge, advanced
a step and then hesitated. He had doubtless
meant to shake hands with her also but, at the
last moment, probably feared a rebuff. At
any rate he nodded, bringing a smile to his
features, and opened the door into the bitter
cold. After he had put on his snowshoes
again and hitched up Maigan to the toboggan
he disappeared into the darkness. For an instant
Madge listened, but she heard no sound.
Everything was still outside, but for the rare
crackings of ice and timber. Seeking her
chair again she leaned forward now with her
elbows resting on her knees and her face held
in the hollow of her hands. At this time a
little child came to her and touched her arm.
She looked at it. The little girl had long
straight black hair, great beady eyes and the
prettiest mouth imaginable. The cheeks were
like red apples. She lifted the little thing
to her knees and the child nestled against her
bosom. Madge now looked at the woman,
busily engaged with her few pots and pans,
and a feeling of envy came to her, a longing
for the sweet and kindly motherhood that was
becoming a fierce craving for that beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
peace which appeared to have become so
firmly established in these little houses of the
frozen wilds. She had elsewhere seen love
of children, little ones petted and made much
of, husbands coming home to a cheery welcome,
but it had not seemed the same. The
women so often seemed weary, pale, and
worked beyond their strength. Most of them
became querulous at times, apt to speak loudly
of intolerable wrongs or of ill-doings of neighbors
across the dark hallways. Here it looked
as if quiet order, cheerful obedience, willingness
on the part of all, were ingrained in the
people. Indeed, it was ever so different.</p>
<p>By this time the rough table was set and
Mrs. Papineau deplored the fact that Hugo
had not consented to remain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heem is &rsquo;urted more as vat he tink,&rdquo; she
confided to the girl. &ldquo;To-morrow somebody
go to de leetle shack an&rsquo; fin&rsquo; &rsquo;ow he is. One
dog heem not much nurse, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words made Madge feel uncomfortable.
Once or twice the idea had come to her
that such a man ought to be punished, that he
should be made to suffer, that he deserved
anything that could make him realize how
heinous his conduct had been. But now she
had a vague impression that she was sorry
for him, that it was on her account that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
refused to stay and had gone out at once in the
gathering darkness that had come so swiftly.
But in spite of these thoughts and of all the
emotions she had undergone Madge felt again
the besetting pangs of fierce hunger. The
slices of moose-meat sizzling in the pan filled
the place with appetizing odor. The mother
placed her brood at the long table but helped
her guest first, and plentifully. How these
people ate and expected others to eat! Never
could they have heard of the scanty meals of
working girls, of the cups of blue milk, of
bitter tea, or of the little rolls and bits of meat
purchased at so-called delicatessen stores.
The girl ate hungrily and the meal was soon
over, but as soon as it was finished the terrible
weariness came upon her again and she was
thankful to lie down upon a hard mattress
of ticking filled with the aromatic twigs of
balsam fir, beneath heavy blankets and a wonderful
robe of hareskins.</p>
<p>Before she could fall asleep, however, the
experiences of her crowded day passed
weirdly before her eyes; yet her despair
seemed to be contending with a strange feeling
that was certainly not hope. It was perhaps
merely a weak acquiescence to conditions
that her immense fatigue and wearied brain
made her accept, dully, stupidly, since she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
lost all power of resistance. It was something
like the enforced peace of a wounded thing that
has just been able to crawl back into its burrow
and has found the rest its body craves for.</p>
<p>In the midst of so large a family one could
not aspire to the lone possession of a bed. The
little girl she had held in her lap had been
placed beside her, not without many apologies
from Mrs. Papineau. In the darkness she
could feel the little warm body nestling
against her, and hear the soft and regular
breathing. It was comforting since it brought
a feeling that the little one protected her, in
some strange way, and was leading her in
paths of darkness with a little warm hand and
a heart that was unafraid and confident of the
morrow&rsquo;s shining sun. Very soon there came
a restless sleep which at first was filled with
uncanny visions, from which she awakened
once or twice in fear. But at last came entire
surcease from suffering as the brain that had
been overwrought ceased to toil.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Hugo had slowly made
his way back to his shack. If his arm hurt he
had now little consciousness of it. The thing
that disturbed him most was that girl&rsquo;s unshakable
belief in his villainy. Was she really
insane? He had had no opportunity to communicate
that thought to Mrs. Papineau.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
But then, after her arrival, she had seemed so
absolutely rational in all that she had said
and done that the idea had, for the time being,
passed away from his mind. And what if, at
least in part, she had spoken the truth? What
if some amazing distortion of reality had
truly and honestly given her these beliefs,
through evidence that must be all against
him? The words she had spoken before starting
for the Papineaus&rsquo;, and the further ones
uttered on the tote-road, while he rested, held
a drama so poignant that it struck a chill to
his heart. She might, after all, have been
speaking the truth as she had been misled
into believing it! But then there must be
some amazing conspiracy at work, some foul
doings whose objects utterly escaped him and
which left him staring at the little lamp now
burning on his table, as if it might perhaps
have revealed some key to the amazing
problem.</p>
<p>Was it possible that a weak and slender
woman could actually be compelled to carry
on a fight against hunger and illness, with
never a friend on earth, until she was finally
so beaten down to the ground that her soul
cried in agony for relief? According to her
she had seized upon the only resource open
to her, in which there was but a dim outlook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
towards safety. Then she had found herself
the victim of a hellish jest, apparently, or of a
conspiracy so base that one sickened at the
mere thought of it. There was no doubt that
those big eyes of the suffering woman haunted
the man, while the accents of her despair still
rang in his ears and distressed him. The expression
of the crucified had been on that pale
face of hers, which had reddened so deeply
when a sense of shame had overwhelmed her.
It was as if he had beheld a drowning woman
and been utterly prevented from extending a
saving hand to her. More strongly he began
to feel that some one had surely sinned against
that woman, and feelings of vengefulness,
none the less bitter for all their vagueness,
began to obsess him.</p>
<p>Once, on his way back from Papineau&rsquo;s,
Maigan had pressed close to him, as if for
safety. From the great hardwood ridges of
his right he had heard a long and familiar
sound. It was the one the Frenchwoman had
mentioned, the fitful baying of wolves on the
track of a deer. Picturing to himself the overtaking
and pulling down of the victim, he
shivered, hardened though he was to the unending
tragedies of the wilderness, and hurried
along faster, although he knew he stood
in no danger.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>When he had reached his shack by the
Roaring River he had entered it and lighted
the small lamp. It chanced to be the last
match in his pocket that he used for the purpose.
There was no need to open the big
package that stood on a shelf, since he remembered
having left two or three small boxes in
his hunting bag. He went over to the corner
where he had left it and bent over, somewhat
painfully. As he lifted it from the floor he
saw an envelope and picked it up. It was
addressed to him. Tearing it open he stared
at the words &ldquo;Starting this evening. Please
have some one meet me. Madge Nelson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With clenched fist he struck the table a
blow that startled Maigan, who barked, leaping
up to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boy,&rdquo; said his master.
&ldquo;Men are pretty big fools, excepting when
they&rsquo;re nothing but infernal cowards. I tell
you, boy, some one will have to pay heavily
for this. Good Lord! Who would have
thought of such a thing? I&ndash;&ndash;I think I must
be getting crazy! But no&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s over there
at Papineau&rsquo;s, and some one wrote to her, and
everything she said was the plain truth, as she
understood it. Great Heavens! It&rsquo;s no wonder
she looked at me as if I&rsquo;d been the dirt
under her feet. That thing&rsquo;s got to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
straightened out, somehow, but first I must
see Stefan, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment a wild idea came to him of
going over to Carcajou in the darkness. Such
an undertaking was by no means particularly
difficult for a strong man, who knew the way,
but suddenly he realized that he was played
out and would never reach his destination that
night. This irked his soul, unbearably, until
he had recourse to his old briar pipe. In
spite of the fact that his arm was beginning to
hurt him badly he sat near the stove, where
he had kindled a fire again, thinking hard.
He was racking his brain to seek some motive
that could have impelled any one he knew to
play such a frightful joke. One after another
he named every man he had ever known or
even merely met in Carcajou and the surrounding,
sparsely settled country. But they
were nearly all friends of his, he knew, or at
least had no reason to bear him ill-will.
There was one chap he had had quite a scrap
with one day, over a dog-fight in which the
man had urged his animal first and then
kicked Maigan when he saw his brute having
by far the worst of it. But soon afterwards
they had shaken hands and the matter had
been forgotten. Besides, the fellow was now
working in Sudbury, far east down the line.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
No, that wasn&rsquo;t a trail worth following. The
more he thought the matter over the more
utterly mysterious it seemed to become. But
of one thing he was determined. He was
going to move heaven and earth to get at the
bottom of all this, and when he found out who
was responsible the fur would fly.</p>
<p>It was perhaps fortunate for her that the
idea of the red-headed girl in old McGurn&rsquo;s
store never entered his head for a moment.
She had always been friendly, perhaps even
a little forward in her attentions to him,
though he had always paid her rather scant
notice. He had never been more than
decently civil to her.</p>
<p>When he sought his bunk, an hour or two
later, a long time elapsed before he could fall
asleep. It seemed to him that his head
throbbed a good deal, and that shoulder was
growing mightily uncomfortable. He hoped
it would be better in the morning. Finally he
fell asleep, restlessly. Upon the floor,
stretched out upon an old deerskin close to
the stove, Maigan was sleeping more profoundly,
though now and then he whined and
sighed in his slumber, perhaps dreaming of
hares and porcupines. A cricket ensconced
beneath the flat stones under the stove began
to chirp, shrilly. Outside a big-horned owl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
was hooting, dismally, while the big falls continued
to roar out their eternal song. And
thus the long night wore out till a flaming
crimson and copper dawn came up, with flashing
rays that stabbed the great rolling clouds
while the trees kept on cracking in the intense
frost and the ice in the big pool churned and
groaned under the torment of waters seeking
to burst their shackles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Carcajou Is Shocked</span></h3>
</div>
<p>After Stefan had started away with Madge,
Miss Sophy McGurn, who had been on
the watch, was delighted to see Mrs. Olsen
coming to the store. She greeted her customer
more pleasantly than ever and served
her with a bag of beans, two spools of black
thread and a pound of the best oleo-butter.
The older woman was nothing loath to talk,
and confirmed the girl&rsquo;s suspicion that Stefan
had taken that young woman to Hugo&rsquo;s. Mrs.
Olsen insisted on the fact that her visitor was
a real pretty girl, though awfully thin and
looking as if a breath would blow her over.
She also commented on the lack of suitable
clothing for such dreadful weather, and on
the utter ignorance Madge seemed to display
of anything connected with Carcajou or, in
fact, any part of Ontario. When questioned,
cautiously, she admitted that she knew no
reason whatever for the girl&rsquo;s coming, but
she hastened to assert that Stefan had said it
was all right, which settled the question, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
with her rather waddling gait, started off for
her house again.</p>
<p>As soon as Stefan returned Sophy saw that
he still had a woman on his toboggan. She
hurried to meet him and was grievously disappointed
when she found out it was Mrs.
Carew. But she boldly went up to Stefan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Stefan!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where did
you leave your passenger of this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Sophy!&rdquo; he answered, placidly.
&ldquo;I leaf de yong leddy vhere she ban going,
I tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t coming back to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe yes, mebbe no,&rdquo; he answered,
grabbing Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s bag and hurrying
with her into the station, for the engine&rsquo;s
whistle announced that he had made the journey
with little or no time to spare.</p>
<p>Sophy made her way back to the store,
meeting Mrs. Kilrea on her way. To this
lady she confided that a young woman had
gone up to Hugo Ennis&rsquo; shack and had not
returned. Wasn&rsquo;t it queer? And Mrs. Olsen
had said that she wasn&rsquo;t Hugo&rsquo;s wife or sister.
Wasn&rsquo;t it funny? But of course she supposed
it was all right.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kilrea called on old Mrs. Follansbee,
who told Mrs. McIntosh. This lady was a
Cree Indian that had become more or less
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
civilized. The white women would speak to
her on account of her husband Aleck, who
was really a very nice man. At any rate all
the ladies of Carcajou were soon aware of the
unusual happening, scenting strange news and
perhaps even a bit of scandal.</p>
<p>Big Stefan, having urged his team to their
utmost, now fed them carefully and locked
them up in his shed, a local habit providing
against bloody fights that were objected to
not so much on moral principle as because
these contests often resulted in the disabling
of valuable animals. It also prevented incursions
among the few sheep of the neighborhood
or long hunts in which dogs indulged by
themselves, returning with sore feet and utterly
unable to move for a day or two. The
animals, before falling asleep, were biting off
the crackling icicles that had formed in the
hair growing between their padded toes. The
journey had not exhausted them in the slightest
and on the morrow they would be perfectly
fit for further travel, if need be.</p>
<p>Neither was Stefan weary. After supper
he quietly strolled over to the store where
some of Carcajou&rsquo;s choicest spirits were gathered,
since the village boasted no saloon.
Here the news was discussed, as spread out by
the few who got a daily or weekly paper from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Ottawa or Sudbury, or gathered in the immediate
neighborhood by the local gossips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Stefan!&rdquo; exclaimed Miles Parker,
who was supposed to watch over the sawmill
and see that the machinery didn&rsquo;t suffer too
much during the long period of disuse. &ldquo;How
did ye find the travelin&rsquo; to-day? See ye didn&rsquo;t
manage ter freeze them whiskers off&rsquo;n yer
face, did ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey&rsquo;re yoost vhere dey belongs, I tank,&rdquo;
answered Stefan, quietly. &ldquo;Miss Sophy, if
you haf time I take two plugs Lumberman&rsquo;s
Joy terbacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stefan he&rsquo;s so all-fired big he got to keep
a chew on each side of his face,&rdquo; explained
Pat Kilrea, a first-rate mechanic who was then
busy with the construction of a little steamer
that was to help tow down to the mill some
big booms of logs, as soon as the lake opened.
&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t able to get no satisfaction except
from double action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this specimen of local wit and humor the
others grinned but Stefan remained quite unmoved.
Miss Sophy waited on him, scanning
his face, eager to ask more questions, while
she feared to say a word. It may have been
her conscience which made her uneasy. Of
course she believed that the precautions she
had taken rendered it impossible for any one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
to accuse her, or at any rate to prove anything.
Still, a certain anxiety remained, which she
was unable to restrain. She would have given
a good deal to know what had taken place.
Never had she doubted that the scene would
occur right there at the station in Carcajou.
That telegram had badly upset her plans, apparently.
And then it was queer that Hugo
had not come down after receiving it, if only
to try to find out what it meant. Finally, one
of the men, having none of her reasons for
keeping still, came forth with a direct
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you got out to Roarin&rsquo; Falls all
safe with that there pooty gal, didn&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>It was Joe Follansbee who had sought this
information, being only too eager to hint at
something wrong on the part of a man he had
long deemed a rival. At his words, however,
Sophy sniffed and turned up her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything very pretty about
her,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t see as how she was so real
awful pretty,&rdquo; Joe hastened to observe. &ldquo;She
ain&rsquo;t the style I admire, by no manner of
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strategic withdrawal was destined to
meet with entire failure, however. Sophy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
turned to the boxes of plug that were stored
on the shelves and pretended to busy herself
with their order and symmetry. But she was
again listening, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye say, Stefan?&rdquo; joined Pat Kilrea.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d she stand the trip? Did ye
see if her nose was still on her face when ye
got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tank so,&rdquo; opened Stefan, gravely, &ldquo;but
it wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much vith de leddy.
Maybe she ain&rsquo;t so much use for it like you
haf for yours, to stick into oder people&rsquo;s
pusinesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan continued to shave off curly bits
from his plug, while the laughter turned
against the engineer. Carcajou, like a good
many other places, commonly favored the
top-dog when it came to betting. The answering
grin in Pat&rsquo;s face was a rather sour one.
If any other man had spoken to him thus there
might have been a lively fight, but no one in
Carcajou, and a good many miles around it,
cared to engage in fisticuffs with the Swede.
A story was current of how he had once manhandled
four drunken lumberjacks, in spite
of peavies and sticks of cordwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re getting to be a good deal of
a lady&rsquo;s man, Stefan,&rdquo; said Aleck McIntosh,
a fellow who was supposed to be a scion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Scottish nobility receiving remittances from
his country. The most evident part of his
income, however, appeared to be contributed
by his Cree wife, who took in the little washing
Carcajou indulged in and made the finest
moccasins in Ontario. &ldquo;Going off with one
and coming back with another. I dare say
you prefer carrying females to lugging the
mails around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe I likes it better but it&rsquo;s more hard
on dem togs,&rdquo; asserted Stefan, judicially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and ye left her at Hugo&rsquo;s shack,
did ye?&rdquo; ventured Pat again, whereat Stefan
nodded in assent and lighted his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say she was anyways related to
him? His sister or something like that?&rdquo;
persisted the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tank she say somethin&rsquo; about bein&rsquo;
his grandmother,&rdquo; retorted Stefan, &ldquo;but I can
tell you something, Pat. If you vant so much
know all about it vhy you not put on your
snowshoes an&rsquo; tak&rsquo; a run down there. It ban a
real nice little valk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Pat Kilrea suffered from the handicap
of having been born with a club-foot, which
didn&rsquo;t prevent him from being an excellent
man with machinery but made walking rather
burdensome for him, the others guffawed
again while the Swede opened the door and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
walked off, the crusted snow crackling under
his big feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course it&rsquo;s none of my business, like
enough,&rdquo; said Pat, virtuously, as he scratched
a match on his trousers&rsquo; leg, &ldquo;but such goings
on don&rsquo;t seem right, nohow. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t right an&rsquo;
proper, because it gives a bad example. I&rsquo;ve
knowed folks rid on a rail or even tarred and
feathered for the like of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carcajou&rsquo;s sterling sense of propriety, as
represented by half a dozen male gossips,
immediately agreed with him. The matter,
they decided, should be looked into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and what d&rsquo;ye think about it,
Miss Sophy?&rdquo; asked Joe, desirous of opening
conversation again with the young woman and
redeeming himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things like that is beneath me to talk
about,&rdquo; she asserted, coldly. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s
more, I don&rsquo;t care to hear about &rsquo;em. It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
time ye got back to the depot, Joe Follansbee
and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to close up anyways and
give ye all a chance to burn your own oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this delicate invitation to vacate the
premises the men rose and trooped out. Once
outside, however, they felt compelled in spite
of the bitter cold to comment a little further
on the situation.</p>
<p>Sophy McGurn put up the large iron bar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
that was used to secure the front door, when
the store was closed. Then she put some
papers away in the safe under the counter and
went up to the family sitting room, where her
mother was knitting and her father, with an
open paper on his lap and his spectacles
pushed up over his forehead, was fast asleep
in a big and highly varnished oaken rocker
trimmed with scarlet plush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to bed,&rdquo; she announced; &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gentleman awoke with a start and
the mother, looking over her glasses, bade her
good-night and sweet dreams, according to a
long-established formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with
Sophy, she&rsquo;s that restless an&rsquo; nervous,&rdquo; said
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She always was, fur&rsquo;s I know,&rdquo; answered
McGurn. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; the complaint
worse she must be sickenin&rsquo; for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject of these remarks, once in her
room, was in no hurry to woo the slumber she
had expressed a desire for. In her mind
anxiety was battling with anger and disappointment.
Whether or not she really loved
Ennis, or had turned to him merely because
his general ways and appearance showed him
to be a man of some breeding, with education
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
superior to the usual standard of Carcajou,
such as she would have been glad to marry,
at any rate her brow narrowed, her lips closed
into a thin straight line and her hands were
clenched tight. What she had done would
probably utterly prevent any renewal of the
friendship she had tried to establish, since
Hugo would perhaps be run out of the place.
Moreover, that girl was really very pretty,
in spite of what she had said downstairs, and
this stranger was now over there. Sophy had
expected to see her return with Stefan, perhaps
also with Hugo, and the girl&rsquo;s face would
have shown marks of tears, and Hugo would
have been in a towering rage, and gradually
the people of Carcajou would have been made
aware, somehow, of what had happened, and
the settler of Roaring Falls would be the butt
of laughter, if not of scurrilous remarks. But
now the dark night had come and Carcajou
was very still under the starlight.</p>
<p>The old cat scratching at her door startled
her. The profound silence that followed appeared
to irk her badly. After a long time
there was the shriek of the night-freight&rsquo;s
whistle and the great rumbling of the arriving
train, the grinding of brakes, shouts that
sounded harshly, various loud thumps as cars
were shunted off to the siding. And then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
train started again, groaning and clattering
and heaving up the grade through the cut,
after which the intense stillness returned and
she lay awake, her eyes peering through darkness,
her senses all alert and her nerves
a-quiver, until nearly the coming of dawn.</p>
<p>But the men who had gone out, before scattering
to their homes, had reached a unanimous
conclusion. It was true that excitement
was rare in Carcajou, but this was a
matter of upholding the fair reputation of the
mill and four or five dozen shacks and frame
houses that constituted the village. It was
decided that a committee must go over to the
Falls and investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say but what Hugo Ennis he&rsquo;s
been mostly all right, fur&rsquo;s we know,&rdquo;
acknowledged Phil Prouty of the section gang.
&ldquo;But then he warn&rsquo;t brought up in these here
parts an&rsquo; he can&rsquo;t be allowed to flout the
morals o&rsquo; this community in any sich way. If
it&rsquo;s like we fears, the gal&rsquo;ll have ter pack off
an&rsquo; him promise ter behave or leave the country.
Them&rsquo;s my sentiments. We better go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, however, there were some objections.
It might be that on the next day the
young woman would return. Then their trip
would be useless. And then two days later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
would be Sunday, on which there would be
less interference with their occupations,
especially as it was the off day in church, where
the services were held but twice a month. It
was voted to start then at an early hour.
There was a strong team of horses used to
lumbering that could be trusted to manage
the old tote-road, drawing Sam Kerrigan&rsquo;s
big sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hosses used ter do it,&rdquo; asserted the latter,
&ldquo;and they kin do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Stefan&rsquo;d take you up with them
dogs of his, Kilrea,&rdquo; suggested one of the men,
grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! And by the way, byes. Ye don&rsquo;t
want ter let that there Swede know nothin&rsquo; of
this. He&rsquo;s too thick with Hugo, he is, and
we don&rsquo;t want him around raisin&rsquo; any ruction
if there happens to be a bit o&rsquo; loud talk. He&rsquo;d
be liable to raise a rumpus, he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeared to be excellent strategy and
it met with unanimous approval. The men
dispersed to their respective shacks and
houses, to discuss the matter further with their
wives, in case any of them were still awake.
One or two of the sturdier ladies at once
volunteered to lend further dignity to the
proceedings with their presence and could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
be dissuaded from joining the Carcajou
Vigilantes.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the unconscious objects
of all these plans were happily unaware of
the fate in store for them. Madge, with a
little child that had snuggled into her arms,
had found a forgetfulness that was a blessing.
In spite of her weariness and of the emotions
she had undergone, the good food and pure
air had produced some effect upon her. She
slumbered perhaps more deeply and restfully
than she had for many long months. And
Hugo Ennis, in pain, tossed in his bunk, his
mind racked with uneasy thoughts and his
wounded shoulder throbbing, till he slept also.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Doubts</span></h3>
</div>
<p>It was with a violent start that Hugo awoke,
feeling chilled to the bone in spite of his
heavy blankets. His injured shoulder was
so stiff that for some minutes he was scarcely
able to move it. He got out of his bunk, his
whole frame shaking with the cold, and
managed to kindle a fire in the stove. But
presently he felt warm again, rather
unaccountably warm, in fact, and his face grew quite
red. Curiously enough, for a man with the
vast appetite of hard workers in cold regions,
he did not at all feel inclined to eat. Yet he
prepared some food, according to custom, and
sat before a tin pint dipper of strong hot tea.
This he managed to swallow, with some
approach to comfort, but when he tried to eat
the first few mouthfuls satiated him and he
pushed the remainder away.</p>
<p>He had opened the door to let Maigan go
out, and when the dog returned after a good
roll in the snow Hugo swept his breakfast of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
rolled oats and bread into a pan and fed it to
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly not going hungry because
my own grub doesn&rsquo;t taste right, old
boy,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>Men of the wilderness learn to speak to
their dogs, or even to think out aloud, when
no living thing chances to be near. It answers
to the inherited need of speech, to an instinct
so long inbred in man that he must needs, at
times, hear the sound of a voice, even if it be
but his own, or go crazy.</p>
<p>Maigan wagged his tail and gobbled up
the food. When he saw his master fastening
on his snowshoes he barked loudly. Hugo
allowed him to romp about for a few minutes
before hitching him up to the toboggan.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they were on their way
to Papineau&rsquo;s. An attempt to smoke his pipe
was immediately abandoned by the young
man. For some reason it tasted wretchedly.
While the start was made at a good pace little
more than a couple of hundred yards had been
covered before Hugo realized that he was
going ever so slowly. Maigan was stopping
all the time and waiting for him. What on
earth was the matter? He judged that the
poor night&rsquo;s sleep had had some ill effect upon
him. It couldn&rsquo;t be his shoulder. Certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
not! The pain in it was no more than any
chap could bear, even if he had to make a wry
face over it at times. He wondered whether
anything he had eaten on the previous day
could have disagreed with him. He decided
that it probably was some canned meat he had
bought at McGurn&rsquo;s. That explained the
thing quite satisfactorily to him. Anyway, it
was bound to wear off soon. Such things
always did. With this cheering thought he
sought to lengthen his stride again, but a
moment later he was dragging himself along,
dully, wondering what was the matter with
him.</p>
<p>He was anxious to see Madge again. He
must tell her of the finding of her message.
Surely he would be able to talk to her, calmly
and quietly, and to obtain from her all that
she knew of this strange jumble of mysteries.
He hoped that she had been able to rest, that
he would find her less weary and
overwrought. This girl had been badly treated,
sinned against most grievously. If there was
anything he could do he would offer his services
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect she&rsquo;ll want to turn right back to
Carcajou,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I wish I were
feeling more fit for the journey. If Papineau
is home from his trapping he will help me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
out. But I&rsquo;ll feel all right soon. This is
bound to pass off. If I get too tired when I
reach Carcajou, Stefan will put me up for the
night. It&ndash;&ndash;it seems a pity that girl will have
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He trudged along behind the toboggan.
He could have ridden on it, most of the way,
but wanted to keep Maigan fresh for the trip
to Carcajou, for the trunk would have to go
also. The light sled was nothing for the dog
to pull, of course, and sometimes he dashed
ahead so that his pace became too great for
his master. Then he would stop and sit down
in his traces, to wait until he was overtaken.
The road was unaccountably long, that morning,
but at last they came in sight of the
Papineau homestead and the cleared land
upon which some crops of oats and potatoes
had already been raised, amid the short
stumps of the half-cleared land. In summer
the river ran very slowly at this place, and
big trout were ever making rings on the
surface which they broke in their dashes after
all sorts of flies and beetles. On the land
opposite, where there had once been a forest
fire, the red weeds that follow conflagrations
grew strong and rank in the summer time and
little saplings sprouted up among the charred
and wrecked trunks of the <i>brul&eacute;</i>. But at this
time it all looked very bleak and desolate.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t ever have lived in such a
country,&rdquo; he told himself, with perhaps a
tinge of regret. &ldquo;Poor little thing, I wonder
what&rsquo;s to become of her? The whole thing&rsquo;s
a shame&ndash;&ndash;a ghastly shame. Wait till Stefan
and I find out all about it. Somebody&rsquo;s got
to get hurt, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maigan had already hauled the toboggan
to the door of the big shack, and the other
animals had come near to renew assurances
of armed neutrality. The good woman of the
house appeared just as Hugo came up. She
must have been rather staggered by his
appearance, for she drew back, staring at him
and shaking her head in decided disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow many mile you call heem to de depot
at Carcajou,&rdquo; she asked him, with hands on
her hips and a severe look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s twelve miles to my shack and
one more to this place,&rdquo; he answered, dully.
&ldquo;You know that just as well as I. Don&rsquo;t you
remember the county surveyors told us so last
year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you tink you goin&rsquo; pull dat toboggan
all way back wid you h&rsquo;arm all bad an&rsquo; you
seek, lookin&rsquo; lak&rsquo; one ghosts! Excuse me,
Monsieur Hugo, but you one beeg fool. My
man Papineau &rsquo;e come back from de traps
to-morrow an&rsquo; heem pull de young lady &rsquo;ome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
wid de dogs. You no fit to go. I tink you go
to bed right now, bes&rsquo; place for you, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled him inside, holding on to his
uninjured arm as if he had been under arrest.
She was a masterful woman, to be sure.
Madge had arisen from a chair and Mrs.
Papineau addressed her. A glance at the
man&rsquo;s countenance had left the girl appalled.
His features were drawn, the brown tint of
his face had changed to a characterless gray,
his eyes looked sunken and brighter, as if
some fever brought a flame into them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you no in h&rsquo;awful beeg &rsquo;urry for to
go &rsquo;ome, Mees?&rdquo; asked the hostess. &ldquo;Dis
man heem real seek. Heem no fit for valk all
vay back to Carcajou now. To-morrow my
man take you. Papineau he no forgif me if I
let Monsieur Hugo go aff an&rsquo; heem so seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course! I&rsquo;m not in any special
hurry. To-morrow will do just as well. He&ndash;&ndash;he
mustn&rsquo;t think of going to-day and&ndash;&ndash;and
it doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least. It&ndash;&ndash;it
makes no difference at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think that you can manage
to stay here for another day?&rdquo; the young man
asked her, as he dropped rather heavily on
a bench by the table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there &rsquo;s
really much the matter with me, really, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
I&rsquo;m sure I could manage it if you&rsquo;re anxious
to get away. But perhaps to-morrow....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Papineau has been ever so kind to
me,&rdquo; answered the girl, slowly. &ldquo;That sort
of thing is such a comfort, especially when&ndash;&ndash;when
one isn&rsquo;t used to it. Nobody ever took
such care of me over there in New York.
I&rsquo;ve had plenty to eat and a nice warm place
to sleep in. I haven&rsquo;t been used to much
luxury where&ndash;&ndash;where I came from. And&ndash;&ndash;and
you mustn&rsquo;t mind me. It will always be
time enough to go, but&ndash;&ndash;but I won&rsquo;t know
how to thank this&ndash;&ndash;this kindly woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugo didn&rsquo;t know whether these words
held a reproach to him, but they sounded very
hopeless and sad. The girl had sat down
again, on a low stool near the fire. A chimney
had been built in a corner, to supplement the
stove, and she was looking intently at the
bright flames leaping up and the fat curling
smoke that rose in little patches, as bits of
white bark twisted and crackled. Mrs. Papineau
had gone back to the stove at the other
end of the room, where she and her eldest girl
had been washing dishes. In the rising sparks
of the logs on fire Madge saw queer designs,
strange moving forms her eyes followed
mechanically. She felt that she was merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
waiting&ndash;&ndash;waiting for the worst that was yet
to come, but the heat was grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case we might as well postpone
the trip for a day,&rdquo; Hugo acknowledged,
somewhat shamefacedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often get
played out but for some reason I&rsquo;m not quite
up to the mark to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep still an&rsquo; rest yourself a bit,&rdquo;
Mrs. Papineau ordered, coming back to him
and feeling his pulse gravely, whereat she
made a wry face. She informed him that he
undoubtedly had a fever and must remain
absolutely quiet while she brewed him a decoction
of potent herbs she had herself picked
and stored away.</p>
<p>Madge looked at Hugo again, anxiously,
feeling that her careless handling of that little
pistol was undoubtedly responsible for his
illness. Their eyes met and he managed to
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mere man can do nothing but obey
when a woman commands, Miss Nelson,&rdquo; he
declared, with a weak attempt at jocularity.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s dreadful stuff she&rsquo;s going to
make me swallow. Still, I&rsquo;m glad of a short
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew his chair a little nearer, and,
speaking in a lower voice, went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Miss Nelson. We&ndash;&ndash;we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
perhaps owe one another some explanations.
It happens that I&rsquo;ve found something. It&rsquo;s
the queerest thing ever happened. I&rsquo;d like
to explain....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use, Mr. Ennis?&rdquo; she replied,
her voice revealing an intense discouragement.
&ldquo;And besides, you are ill now. It&ndash;&ndash;it
doesn&rsquo;t really matter what has happened,
I suppose. I couldn&rsquo;t expect anything else, I
dare say. I was a fool to come, to&ndash;&ndash;to believe
what I did. And&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m ashamed, it&ndash;&ndash;it
seems as if the least little pride that was
left me has gone&ndash;&ndash;gone for ever. Please&ndash;&ndash;please
don&rsquo;t say anything more. It distresses
me and can&rsquo;t possibly do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away from him to stare into the
fire again and watch the little tongues of flame
following threads of dry moss, till her face,
which had colored for a moment, became pale
again and her lips quivered at the thoughts
that had returned to her. Uppermost was
that feeling of shame of which she had spoken.
She had realized that she had come to this
man she had never met, ready to say: &ldquo;Here
I am, Madge Nelson, to whom you wrote in
New York. If you really want me for your
wife I am willing. In exchange for food, for
rest, for a little peace of mind I am ready to
try to learn to love you, to respect and obey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
you, and I will be glad to work for you, to
keep your home, to do my duty like a diligent
and faithful wife.&rdquo; But the man had looked
at her with eyes genuinely surprised, because
he had not really expected her. And of course
she had found no favor in his sight. She was
an inconvenient stranger whom he did not
know how to get rid of, and on the spur of the
moment he had found recourse in clumsy lies.
By this time he had probably thought out
some fables with which he expected to soothe
her. At any rate he must despise her, in spite
of the fact that he seemed to try to be civil
and even kind. The important thing was that
the end had come. In her little purse six or
seven dollars were left, not enough to take her
even half the distance to New York, to the
great city she had learned to hate and fear.
For nothing on earth would she have accepted
money from Hugo. At least that shred of
pride remained. It was therefore evident that
but one way, however dark, was open before
her, since the end must come.</p>
<p>But that unutterable weariness was still
upon her. She was not pressed for time, thank
goodness. She had been given food in abundance
and unwonted warmth and, for some
hours, the wonderful sharp tingling air of the
forest had driven the blood more swiftly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
through her veins. Moments had come during
which it had seemed a blessing merely
to breathe and a marvelous gift to be free
from pain. But she was not so very strong yet.
In another day, or perhaps two, she might feel
better able to take that last leap. It would be
that river&ndash;&ndash;the Roaring River. That&ndash;&ndash;that
little gun made horrid jagged wounds.
On her way to Papineau&rsquo;s she had noticed any
number of great air-holes in the ice. In such
places she had even heard the rumbling of the
water on its rushing journey towards the sea.
It seemed an easy, restful, desirable end to all
her troubles. She would slip away by herself
and these dear kindly people would never
know, she hoped. Like so many others, she
had gambled and lost, and perhaps she deserved
to lose. Who could say? If she had
sinned in coming to this place she would bear
the punishment bravely. It would surely be
very swift; there would be but a gasp or two
from the stunning chill of the icy water, after
which must come swift oblivion. The world
was indeed a very harsh and dangerous place.
She would be glad to leave it; there could be
nothing to regret.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes once more and looked
about her. The heat from the birchen logs
and the sizzling jack-pine penetrated her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Somewhere she had read or heard that, to
those condemned, a few last comforts were
usually proffered. It would be easier to find
the end after a few more hours of this blessed
peace. It would have been more gruesome
to meet it while suffering from hunger with
the very marrow of one&rsquo;s bones freezing and
one&rsquo;s teeth chattering. She was glad enough
to sit still on that rough stool. She did not
want to be taken back, even to that little village
of Carcajou. The little children had
made such good friends with her, and would
have climbed all over her had their mother
not reproved them; the very dogs had come
up and rubbed against her, and put their
muzzles in her lap. Two of them were but
half-grown pups. And best of all the big-hearted
and full-bosomed mother of the family
always spoke in words that were so
friendly, even affectionate. It had been a
wonderful vision of a better world from
which she did not want to awaken too soon.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Hugo had been compelled,
not without a wry face, to swallow the
bitter potion Mrs. Papineau had prepared
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rest one leetle time yet,&rdquo; ordered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
housewife. &ldquo;You haf noding for to do.
Feel better soon when you rest after de medicine.
You no &rsquo;urry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing loath he had sat down
again, with his chair tilted back a little till
the back rested on the table. Madge was
sitting nearly in front of him, with her back
slightly turned, and he could see the tightly
pinned mass of the hair he had seen flooding
her shoulders in his shack, and the comely
curve of her neck as she leaned forward, staring
into the fire. For a time this drove away
the pain that was in his wounded arm and the
hot, throbbing feeling of discomfort that it
gave him. What irked him was the realization
of the tragedy brought to this girl somehow
and the understanding of all that she
must have suffered.</p>
<p>Hugo had not always lived in the wilderness.
He also had been of the town during a
period of his life, until the longing had come
for the greater freedom of the open spaces, of
the regions which in their greatness bring
forth the sturdier qualities of manhood.</p>
<p>He was thinking of the scorn that had been
in her voice when she had told him of the
fierce impulse that had bidden her escape
from the bondage of carking poverty and care.
It had only resulted in bringing disappointment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and the shame, the outraged womanhood
that had burned upon her cheeks. And
this appealed to him with an irresistible force
since that effort on her part showed that she
at least possessed courage and the readiness to
go far afield in search of an avenue of escape.
Weaker souls would long ago have given up
the fight.</p>
<p>He had just tried to begin an explanation
and find the truth out from her, but she had
shaken her head and said it was useless. She
did not understand; how could she? Yet he
had been sorely disappointed. It had scarcely
been a rebuff on her part for she had spoken
gently enough, in that low despairing voice of
hers. He must wait another and better occasion
and hope that he would be able to clear
himself of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>At this time a man&rsquo;s practical nature suggested
to him the thought that she must be
very poor&ndash;&ndash;that she had perhaps expended
her last resources in coming to Carcajou. If
this was the case, what would it avail for him
to take her back to the railway? What would
happen to her then? He could not allow her
to depart without finding out how such matters
stood, and he wondered in what manner
he could make her accept some money and
how he could make amends to her for the injury
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
she had sustained at some unknown individual&rsquo;s
hands. But the more he puzzled
his brain the less he could discover any efficient
way of coming to her assistance. She
had said that every bit of pride had been torn
from her, but he knew that this was not altogether
true. The flashing of her eyes and the
indignation of her voice had contradicted her
words efficiently. She would probably resent
his offer, refuse to accept anything from him.
Yet, if he managed to persuade her that he
was guiltless, it was possible....</p>
<p>But here his thoughts were interrupted by
Mrs. Papineau, who insisted on inspecting
his wound again and made a wry face when
she looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you pardon for to tell de truth,
Monsieur Hugo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I tink you
one beeg fool man for come here to-day. I
tink maybe you get bad seek wid dat h&rsquo;arm.
You stay &rsquo;ere to-day an&rsquo; for de night. I make
you a bed in dis room on de floor, by Jacques
an&rsquo; Baptiste an&rsquo; Pierre. My man Philippe &rsquo;e
come to-morrow, maybe to-night, an&rsquo; I send
heem to Carcajou so he telegraph to de <i>docteur</i>
for see you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully good, Mrs. Papineau,&rdquo;
answered the young man, with the obstinacy
of his kind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly sure I&rsquo;ll be all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
right to-morrow, or the next day at the most.
And I&rsquo;ll come back and see how Miss Nelson
is getting on. I think I&rsquo;ll move now so I&rsquo;ll
say good-by. I&rsquo;m a lot better now. I suppose
it&rsquo;s on account of that stuff you made me
drink; it was bad enough to be fine medicine.
I hope the rest will do you some good also,
Miss Nelson. You&rsquo;re looking a lot better
than yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Papineau first thought of preventing
his exit by main force but felt compelled to
let him have his way. She lacked the courage
of her convictions and allowed him to depart,
with his dog running ahead with the toboggan.
She peered at him through one of the
small panes and saw that he was walking
fairly easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe heem be all right soon,&rdquo; she confided
hopefully to Madge, while she mixed
dough in a pan. &ldquo;But heem one beeg fool
man all de same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I can hardly believe that,&rdquo; objected
the girl. &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All mans is beeg fools ven dey is &rsquo;urted or
seek, my dear. Dey don&rsquo;t know nodings &rsquo;ow
to tak&rsquo; care for heemselves. Dey don&rsquo;t never
haf sense dat vay. Alvays tink dey so strong
noding happen, ever. But just same Hugo
Ennis one mighty fine man, I say dat sure. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
rather de ole cow die as anyting &rsquo;appen to
heem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without interrupting her work, and later
as she toiled, at her washtub, the good woman
launched forth in lengthy praise of Hugo.
From her conversation it appeared that he
had helped one or two fellows with small
sums of money and good advice. In the
autumn he had fished out an Indian who had
upset his boat while netting whitefish in rough
weather, on the lake, and every one knew that
Stefan&rsquo;s life had been saved by him. At any
rate the Swede said so, for Hugo never liked
much to speak of such things. And then he
was a steady fellow, a hard worker, good at
the traps and not afraid of work of any kind.
And then he was friendly to everybody. Had
Madge noticed how gentle he was with the
little children? That was always a sign of a
good man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mees,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;Some time
I tink heem de bes&rsquo; man as ever lif. Heem
Hugo not even &rsquo;urt one dog, or anyting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt even a dog! Madge
repeated these words to herself. Then why
had he played such a sorry joke on a woman
who had never injured him? She wondered
whether he would be sorry, afterwards, if&ndash;&ndash;if
he ever chanced to learn what had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
of her&ndash;&ndash;after everything was all over. It
might be that he had just been a big fool, as
the Canadian woman had called him, and
never reflected on the possible consequences
of his action. But then he should have had
the manhood to acknowledge his fault and
beg her pardon, instead of resorting at once
to clumsy lies and pretending utter ignorance.
In many ways such conduct seemed inconsistent
with the man, now that she had had
further opportunity of seeing him. And then
there was no doubt that he looked very ill.
She was really very sorry for her share in that
accident, and yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet men had been
shot dead for smaller offenses than he had
meted out to her. He might have been killed,
of course, and her quickened imagination
caused her to see him stretched stark upon the
floor of that little cabin, on those rough
boards that smelled of resiny things. And
then people would have come and she would
have been accused of his murder, of course.
It would have been her weapon that had done
it, and they would have found motive enough
for the deed in the story she would have been
compelled to relate. They wouldn&rsquo;t have
believed in any accident. And then, instead
of being able to end everything in some air
hole of Roaring River, she would have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
dragged to some jail to eke out her days in a
prison, if she had not been hanged.</p>
<p>The next day she awaited his coming somewhat
anxiously. She felt that she must know
how he was before&ndash;&ndash;before taking that last
step. After all he had tried to be considerate,
except in the matter of those amazing lies.
During the afternoon Mrs. Papineau, growing
anxious, sent little Baptiste over to enquire
after him. The small boy returned, saying
that he had seen two squirrels and a rabbit on
the tote-road, and the track of a fox, and that
he had found Hugo sitting by the fire. And
Hugo had declared that he was all right and&ndash;&ndash;and
perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t pleased, because he
spoke very shortly and had told him to hurry
home. So Baptiste had left, and on his way
he had seen partridges sitting on a fir sapling,
and if he&rsquo;d had a gun, or even some rocks....</p>
<p>But this circumstantial narrative was interrupted
by the barking of the dogs. The
sun was about setting. Madge looked out of
the window, while Mrs. Papineau rushed to
the door. It was a man arriving with a toboggan
and two big dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat my man Philippe coming,&rdquo; announced
the woman, happily.</p>
<p>She held the door open, letting in a blast
of cold air, and the man entered, tired with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
long tramping. From the toboggan he removed
a load of pelts, dead hares that would
serve chiefly for bait, his blankets and the
indispensable axe. Mrs. Papineau volubly
explained the guest&rsquo;s presence and he greeted
her kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You frien&rsquo; of Hugo Ennis,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Den you is velcome an&rsquo; me glad for see you,
<i>mademoiselle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a pleasant-faced, stocky and broad-limbed
man of rather short stature, and his
manner was altogether kindly and pleasant.
The simplicity and cordiality of his manner
was entirely in keeping with the ways of his
family. It was curious that all the people
she had met so far seemed to have come to an
agreement in speaking well of Ennis.</p>
<p>The man sat down, after the smallest of the
children had swarmed all over him, and took
off his Dutch stockings, waiting for the plenteous
meal and the hot tea his wife was preparing.
Meanwhile, to lose no time, he began
to skin a pine marten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plent&rsquo; much good luck dis time,&rdquo; he said,
turning to Madge. &ldquo;Five <i>vison</i>, vat you call
mink, and a pair martens. Also one fox, jus&rsquo;
leetle young fox but pelt ver&rsquo; nice. You want
for see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She inspected the pelts and looked at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
animals that were yet unskinned, realizing for
the first time how men went off in the wilds
for days and weeks and months at a time, in
bitterest weather, to provide furs for fine
ladies.</p>
<p>The darkness had come and the big oil
lamp was lighted. The children played about
her for a time and gradually sought their
couches in bunks and truckle-beds. The man
was relating incidents of the trapping to his
wife, who nodded understandingly. Beaver
were getting plentiful along the upper reaches
of the Roaring; it was a pity that the law prevented
their killing for such a long time. He
had seen tracks of caribou, that are scarce in
that region; but they were very old tracks,
not worth following, since these animals are
such great travelers.</p>
<p>During this conversation Madge would
listen, at times, and turn towards the door.
She had a vague idea that Ennis might come,
since the boy&rsquo;s account had been somewhat
reassuring. When she finally went to bed
behind an improvised screen in a corner of
the big living-room, she was long unable
to sleep, owing to obsessing thoughts that
wouldn&rsquo;t be banished. Over and over again
she reminded herself of all that had happened.
It stood to reason that the man had written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
those letters; how could it be otherwise? The
proofs in her hands were too conclusive to
permit her to pay any heed to his denials.
The amazing thing was that when one looked
at him it became harder and harder to believe
him capable of such wrongdoing.</p>
<p>As she tossed in her bed she began to be
assailed with doubts. These worried her exceedingly.
He had firmly asserted his innocence.
Supposing that he was telling the
truth, what then? In such a case, impossible
as it seemed, she had accused him unjustly,
and her conduct towards him had been unpardonable.
And then she had refused to
listen to him, when he had sought to begin
some sort of explanation. Why shouldn&rsquo;t one
believe a man with such frank and honest eyes,
one who wouldn&rsquo;t harm even a dog and was
loved and trusted by little children? Of
course, it was quite unintentionally that she
had wounded his body, but if he chanced to
be innocent she had also wounded his feelings,
deeply, in spite of which he had seemed sorry
for her, and had been very kind. He had
promised to come again to give her further
help. If he was guilty it was but a sorry
attempt to make slight amends. If he was
not at fault, it showed that he was a mighty
fine man. Madge felt that she would rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
believe in his innocence, in spite of the fact
that if he could prove it she would be covered
with confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that I ought to have given
him that opportunity he was seeking,&rdquo; she told
herself, rather miserably.</p>
<p>Before she fell asleep she decided that on
the morrow she would walk over to his shack
if he did not turn up in the forenoon. He
might be in want of care, in spite of what the
small boy had said. If he was all right she
would sit down and question him. The letters
she had received were in her bag; she
would show them to him. Now that she
thought of it, the curious, ill-formed, hesitating
character of the writing seemed utterly
out of keeping with the man&rsquo;s apparent nature.
He ought to have written strongly and boldly,
it seemed to her. Gradually she was becoming
certain that his word of honor that he had
never penned them, or caused some one else
to do it for him, would suffice to change the
belief she had held. Yes&ndash;&ndash;she would go
there, even before noon. If she met him on
the road they could as well speak out in the
open air. And if she could be sure that she
had been mistaken in regard to him, she would
beg his pardon, because he had tried to be
good to her, with little encouragement on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
part. She&ndash;&ndash;she didn&rsquo;t want him to think
afterwards&ndash;&ndash;when everything would be
ended, that she had been ungrateful and unjust.
Of course, the great effort had failed;
nearly everything was ended now and there
were no steps that could be retraced. Someone
had been very wicked and cruel, that was
certain. But she didn&rsquo;t care who it was; it
could make no difference. She really hoped
it was not Hugo Ennis.</p>
<p>In the darkness her tense features relaxed
and her body felt greater ease. Finally her
eyes closed and she slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>For the Good Name of Carcajou</span></h3>
</div>
<p>The morning came clear and somewhat
warmer. Beyond the serrated edges of
the woodlands covering far-away hills were
masses of sunlit rolling clouds that seemed
as if they were utterly immovable and piled
up as a background to the purpling beauty of
the mountains.</p>
<p>Madge awoke early. Outside the house
the dogs were stirring, the two young ones
chasing one another over the snow and rolling
over it while the others nosed about more
sedately. She heard a ponderous yawn from
Papineau, on the other side of the slender
partition, and a general scurrying of small
feet and the moving of washbasins. When
she came out Mrs. Papineau had already
kindled the wood in the fireplace and was
stirring the hot embers in the stove. From
without she heard sounds of lusty chopping.</p>
<p>She wrapped a borrowed knitted scarf
about her neck and put on Hugo&rsquo;s woolen
<i>tuque</i>, after which she stepped out. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
was a wondrous brilliancy over the world.
On trees hung icicles that took on the appearance
of gems. The cold air made her breathe
so deeply that she felt amazingly strong and
well. The oldest boy&rsquo;s smiting with his axe
came in thumps that awakened a little echo,
coming from over there where the river narrowed
down between high banks. It was very
wonderful; it gave one a desire to live; it
seemed a pity that one must so soon say
good-by to all this. It&ndash;&ndash;it was perhaps better
not to think of that just now.</p>
<p>She went indoors again. There were potatoes
to be peeled and the girl, in spite of protests,
took up a knife and went to work. It
was such a pleasure to do something to help.
Indeed she had been idle too long, allowing
these people to do everything for her while
she crouched disconsolately in warm corners.
At present all the weariness and weakness
seemed to have left her. It was just like a
fresh beginning instead of the ending of a life.
It would have made her happy to think that,
somewhere in the world, providing it were
away from the city, she might have found
honest work to do in exchange for some of this
wonderful peace. If she could only have remained
among these gentle and placid people
and let her existence flow on, easily, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
pain and the constant worry for the morrow.
It was like some marvelous dream from which
she was compelled to awaken at once, for she
realized that there was no place for her in this
household. The older children were already
of the greatest assistance to their parents, and
there was no room for her in the crowded
shack. She had caused these people some inconvenience,
which they had accepted cheerfully,
it was true, but which she could not
keep on inflicting on them. But for some
hours&ndash;&ndash;some blessed hours, she could play
at being happy and pretend that life was
sweet. She could smile now, when these
people spoke to her, and she hugged some of
the little ones without apparent reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay &rsquo;ere some more day,&rdquo; Mrs. Papineau
told her, &ldquo;an&rsquo; den you look lak&rsquo; oder gal
sure. Get fat an&rsquo; lose de black roun&rsquo; you
h&rsquo;eyes. You now a tousan&rsquo; time better as ven
you come, you bet. Dis a fine coontree, Canada,
for peoples get strong an&rsquo; hoongree an&rsquo;
work &rsquo;ard an&rsquo; sleep good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfectly beautiful and wonderful
country,&rdquo; cried the girl, enthusiastically. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I
wish I could always live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You one so prettee gal,&rdquo; commented the
good woman. &ldquo;Some day you fin&rsquo; one good
&rsquo;usban&rsquo; an&rsquo; marry an&rsquo; h&rsquo;always lif in dis coontree.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Den you is happy and strong. Plenty
mans in dis coontree want wife to &rsquo;elp an&rsquo;
mak&rsquo; good &rsquo;ome. It one h&rsquo;awful big lan&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there was any amount of room in this
great country. And the woman wanted her
to go and find a good husband! Well, she had
come far to seek one. It&ndash;&ndash;it had not been a
pleasant experience. She saw herself wandering
about this wilderness looking for another
man who would take her to wife. Oh,
the shame of it&ndash;&ndash;the hot flashing of her
cheeks when she thought of it! No, she was
now looking on all this as a pauper looks into
the shop-front displaying the warm clothing
that would keep the bitter cold from him, or
as starvelings of big cities, through the windows
of great restaurants and hostelries, stare
upon the well-fed people sating themselves
with an abundance of good cheer. She must
remain outside and now the end of it all was
near.</p>
<p>They had their breakfast, during which
Mrs. Papineau said that she was becoming
anxious about Hugo. Presently she would
send one of the children again. Papineau
wouldn&rsquo;t do because he knew nothing about
sick people. She would go over there herself
soon. If he was sick she would bring him a
loaf of bread. It would soon be ready to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
bake; the dough was still rising behind the
stove. There might be other things to be attended
to. Not more than an hour would
elapse before she was ready to go. She remarked
that men were a very helpless lot
whenever they were ill, and became grumpy
and took feminine tact to manage.</p>
<p>The feeling of anxiety that had gradually
come over the girl became deeper. If the
man was ill, it was her fault. What had possessed
her to spend some of her scant store of
money in that dirty little shop for a pistol?
Of course, she realized that a vague feeling of
danger had guided her&ndash;&ndash;that the thing could
be a means of defense or offer a way to end
her troubles. And it had only served to injure
a man who, if he had sinned against her,
manifested at any rate some desire to treat
her kindly.</p>
<p>But the thought that he might not be guilty
returned to her, insistently. It was on her
part a change of thought that was not due to
carefully reasoned considerations, to any deep
study of conditions, for when she tried to
argue the matter out she became involved in a
thousand contradictions and her head would
begin to ache in dizzy fashion. Rather it was
some sort of instinct, one of the conclusions
so often and quickly reached by the feminine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
mind and apt, in spite of everything, to prove
accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Papineau,&rdquo; she said, suddenly, &ldquo;I
think I will go over there now. I&ndash;&ndash;I have
rested long enough and the fresh air will be
good for me. I will come back very soon, I
suppose, but if&ndash;&ndash;if Mr. Ennis should be ill
you will find me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her proposal was assented to without the
slightest objection. The good woman insisted
on furnishing her with footwear better suited
to the tote-road than the boots she wore. On
the trail the snow would be fairly well beaten
down and there would be little need of snowshoes
if she picked her way carefully. She
could not lose her way. Still, it might be as
well for one of the children to go with her.
People who were not used to the woods sometimes
strayed off a trail and got in trouble.</p>
<p>Under escort of the second oldest girl
Madge started, briskly. She had covered but
a short distance before she wondered that she
felt so strong and well. The plain substantial
food she had eaten and the bright, stimulating
air were filling her with a new life. She
walked along quite fast, for she was now
anxious to see this man again. If she had
been wrong she wanted to make amends. But
what if he were very ill? She thought of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
lonely little shack and the lack of any comfort
and care within it. He might be lying there
helplessly, with only a dog for a companion.
At every turn of the little road she looked
ahead, keenly, thinking that perhaps she
might meet him on his way to the Papineau&rsquo;s.
As she hurried on she felt that the house had
perhaps been too warm and it was splendid to
be walking beneath the snow-laden trees, to
see the little clouds of her breath going out
into the frosty air and to hear the crackling of
the clean snow under her feet.</p>
<p>The child was walking sturdily at her side
and told her of some Christmas presents Hugo
had brought. It was evident that to the children
of that family he was a very wonderful
being, a sort of Santa Claus who had done his
full duty and one to be forever after welcomed
with joyous shrieks. And father said
he was a very good shot, and Stefan Olsen,
the big man, thought there was no one like
him. And he could sing songs and tell stories,
wonderful stories. Madge, as she listened to
the girl, suddenly wondered whether it was
not possible that the loneliness of such a life
might not in some way have disturbed the
man&rsquo;s mind, at least temporarily. Wasn&rsquo;t it
possible for one, in such a case, to do queer
things and never remember anything about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
them afterwards? No one better than she
knew what a terrible and maddening thing
loneliness was. She recollected distracting
hours spent in little hall-bedrooms while she
tried to mend, after an exhausting day&rsquo;s work,
the poor clothing that wore out so terribly
soon, and how at times she had felt that she
must be becoming crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no! He couldn&rsquo;t have done it. He&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
a very quiet sensible man, I should
think, and&ndash;&ndash;and he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt even a
dog,&rdquo; she repeated to herself.</p>
<p>They were journeying quite fast over the
trail that snaked along through the woods,
bending here and there in order to avoid
boulders and stumps and fallen trees but
always coming in sight of the frozen river
again. At times Madge trudged through
rather deep snow. Also she stubbed her toes
upon rocks and stumbled over branches
broken off by the great gales of winter. But it
really wasn&rsquo;t very hard. And the child kept
on chattering about Monsieur Hugo and asking
eager questions about the big city. Was it
true that as far as one could see there were
houses standing right up against one another
for miles and miles, and that people swarmed
in them as do the wild bees in hollow trees?
It was natural for bees to do such things, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
for ants, and for the minnows in shoals down
in the river, but why did people have to crowd
in such a way? How could they breathe?</p>
<p>Finally they came in sight of the shack and
the child gave a swift glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No smoke, mees,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Heem go
away, or mebbe heem seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge hurried along faster for an instant,
and then stopped short. What if neither of
the child&rsquo;s conclusions was correct? If she
went over there and knocked at the door he
might come out, looking rather surprised.
She had told him that she had come to Carcajou,
looking for an unknown husband, for a
man she was willing to accept under certain
conditions, just because her life had become
intolerable. He might lift his brow and perhaps
ask her quite civilly to come in. But
what would he think? Would he imagine
that she was running after him and trying to
compel him to marry her? It was not alone
the frost that brought color to her cheeks now.
No, it would never do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will wait here,&rdquo; she told the
little girl. &ldquo;Will you please go and find out
if Mr. Ennis is there, and whether he is all
right again? I&rsquo;ll sit down on this log and
wait till you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child looked rather puzzled but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
ran down the path that led to the cabin.
Madge saw her stopping in front of the door,
at which she knocked. She heard her call
out and then wait, as if listening. At once
came Maigan&rsquo;s voice. He was barking but
the sound was not an angry one. Rather it
sounded plaintively. Finally the girl pulled
the door open, after fumbling at the latch, and
the dog ran out, barking again and rolling in
the snow. Then he sniffed the air and discovered
Madge, at once running towards her and
pushing his muzzle in her hand. She stroked
his head and he ran back, going but a few
steps and turning around to see if she followed.
She rose slowly, a sense of fear coming
over her, and hesitatingly went down the
path also. At this moment the child came out,
looking frightened, and hastened over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heem seek&ndash;&ndash;very seek,&rdquo; she cried, and
Madge found herself running now, with her
heart beating and her breath coming fast.
The terrifying idea came to her that perhaps
he was dead. But as she entered the place
the man rose painfully on his bunk. His face
was amazingly pale and his features drawn&ndash;&ndash;hardly
recognizable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, must beg your pardon&ndash;&ndash;I intended
to come over,&rdquo; he told her, hoarsely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
&ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s some silly sort of a fever. I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll
be better pretty soon. It&rsquo;s that blessed
arm of mine, I think, and&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m frightfully
thirsty. If&ndash;&ndash;if you&rsquo;ll ask the kid....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge peered about her, but there was no
water in sight. Even if there had been any
she knew it would have frozen solid in the
fireless shack whose interior had struck a chill
through her. She seized a pail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does one get it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Or
do you have to melt ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a spring. It&rsquo;s halfway down to
the pool. Never quite freezes over. Let that
girl go for it, Miss Nelson. Or&ndash;&ndash;or I may
go myself in a minute. Only waiting till&ndash;&ndash;till
my teeth stop chattering. Then I can
light&ndash;&ndash;light the fire and&ndash;&ndash;and make hot tea.
It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s such a stupid nuisance and&ndash;&ndash;and
I&rsquo;m giving you a lot of bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Madge ran out of the shack and down
to that spring, where the clear water seemed
to be boiling out of the ground, since a little
cloud of steam rose from it. But it was just
pure icy water and she filled the pail and
hurried back with it. When she returned the
child was efficiently engaged in making a fire
in the little stove. The man had sunk down
on his bunk again and she went up to him.
His teeth were no longer chattering, but his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
cheekbones now bore patches of deep red.
When she ventured to touch his hand, she
found that it was burning hot. At this an
awful, distressing, unreasoning fear came
upon her. She&ndash;&ndash;she had killed this man, for&ndash;&ndash;for
he certainly was going to die, she
thought. Even in the big hospital she had
never seen a face more strongly stamped
with the marks of impending death. It was
frightful!</p>
<p>She gave him water which he drank greedily,
calling for more. She had to hold the
cup, since his hand shook too badly. Dully,
feeling stricken with a great desolation, she
prepared some tea and gave it to him. She
had found some biscuits in a box but he refused
to eat anything. Presently he was lying
flat again on his bunk, with his eyes closed,
and when she spoke he made no answer. But
he was breathing, she noted. Perhaps he had
fallen asleep. It might do him a great deal
of good, she thought.</p>
<p>The child had thrown herself down on the
floor, next to Maigan, who was stretched out
at length, enjoying the welcome heat of the
stove. From time to time the animal lifted
his head and looked towards his master
anxiously. He knew that something was all
wrong, but now that these other people had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
come everything would doubtless be made all
right.</p>
<p>For some time Madge kept still, sitting
down on a stool she had drawn to the side of
the bunk. She had the resigned patience innate
in so many women, but presently she could
stand it no longer. Something must be done
at once. Valuable time was passing and no
help was being obtained. Things simply
couldn&rsquo;t go on this way!</p>
<p>Rising again she called the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go and get a doctor at once,&rdquo; she
whispered, breathlessly. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m horribly
afraid. Come outside with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught the little girl&rsquo;s arm in her impatience,
and took her out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your&ndash;&ndash;your friend, Monsieur Hugo, is
dreadfully ill, do you understand, child? I
heard your mother say that one could telegraph
from Carcajou for a doctor. We&rsquo;ve
got to do it! How long would it take me to
get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was evidently scared, but she
looked at Madge with some of the practical
sense of one versed with the difficulties of life
in the wilds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you &rsquo;lone you never get dere. If
Maigan work for you maybe three-four
hour,&rdquo; answered the child. &ldquo;Heem go a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
leetle way den turn back for de shack. No
leave master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came upon Madge a dreadful feeling
of helplessness. The man looked terribly
ill; she felt that he was probably going to
die. This great wilderness suddenly grew as
wicked in her eyes as that of the city. Nay, it
was even worse. She remembered how ill
she had become and how she had struggled to
fight off the sickness, in a little lone room of a
top floor. But as soon as people had come she
had been bundled away to the hospital. A
wagon had come, with a doctor in a white
coat, and they had clattered off. The people
in the hospital had seemed interested, indifferent,
friendly, according to their several
dispositions, but she had been taken care of,
and fed, and washed, and some of the nurses
had sweet faces, after all, and after a time she
had recovered. All this had seemed rather
terrible at the time, but what was it compared
to this lying desperately ill in a freezing
hut, too feeble to procure even the cup of
water craved by a dry tongue and lips that
were parched?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can surely walk that distance,&rdquo; she cried,
but the child shook her head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no good for walk far,&rdquo; she asserted.
&ldquo;You jus&rsquo; fall down dead. Twelve mile and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
snow deep some place. Moch cole as freeze
you quick when tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; asked Madge,
entering the house again, followed by the
child. &ldquo;I think I ought to try to get to
Carcajou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the man, hoarsely,
looking as if he had awakened suddenly, and
lifting himself up on one elbow painfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be all right to-morrow, sure&ndash;&ndash;surest
thing you know, and&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;ll take
you down myself, with old&ndash;&ndash;old Maigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please hurry back to your house and tell
your mother to come over as soon as she can,&rdquo;
Madge told the child. &ldquo;Perhaps your father
could go. I didn&rsquo;t think of it at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you spik&rsquo; lak&rsquo; you know someting,&rdquo;
said the girl, with refreshing frankness. &ldquo;I
&rsquo;urry all right. Get modder quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started, her little legs flying over the
snow, and Madge closed the door again.</p>
<p>She put a little more wood in the stove and
sat down by the bunk. The man&rsquo;s eyes were
closed again. It was strange that he had
heard her so distinctly, and that he had gathered
the impression that she wanted to get to
Carcajou on her own account. And&ndash;&ndash;and
he had said he would take her himself. Again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
his first thought had been to do something for
her, to be of service to her.</p>
<p>One of his hands was lying outside the
blankets, and instinctively Madge placed her
own upon it. She was frightened to feel how
hot it was. The pulse her fingers sought was
beating wildly. She felt glad that she was
there. The man didn&rsquo;t care for her and she&ndash;&ndash;well,
she supposed that she disliked him,
but she wasn&rsquo;t going to let him die there
alone in a corner, like a wounded animal in
some obscure den among the rocks. For the
moment her own troubles were pretty nearly
forgotten, for there was something for her to
do. She had been but a useless by-product
of humanity in the great melting pot of the
world and had proved incapable of rising
above the dross and making even a poor place
for herself. But this man was young and
strong and able, bearing all the marks of one
destined to be of use. He had looked splendid
in his efficient and sturdy manhood and therefore
there was something wrong, utterly
wrong and against the course of nature in his
being about to be snuffed out before her very
eyes, just because she had dropped that abominable
pistol. It&ndash;&ndash;it just couldn&rsquo;t be!</p>
<p>She leaned forward again and looked upon
his face, that was ashen under the coating of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
tan. Once he opened his eyes and looked at
her, but the lids closed down again and once
more she became obsessed by the idea that she
might have been very unjust to him, that she
had perhaps insulted and wronged him. All
at once the face she was looking at became
blurred, but it was because she saw it through
a mist of gathering tears. It had been easy,
when she had bought that pistol, to think
of killing a man; now it seemed frightful,
abominable, and the resentment she had felt
against the man was turning against herself in
spite of the fact that it had been an accident,
just a miserable accident.</p>
<p>Long minutes, forty or fifty of them, went
by as she waited and listened. But presently
Maigan, that had laid his head in her lap and
was looking at her pitifully, as if he had been
begging her to help the man he loved, rose
suddenly and dashed to the door, barking.
It proved to be Papineau and his wife, who
was very breathless.</p>
<p>The man came in, looked at Hugo and
rushed out again. He took the time to exchange
his toboggan for Hugo&rsquo;s, which was
lighter and to which he hitched his three
powerful dogs. Madge went to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hurry, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m horribly afraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t come back without a doctor will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet de life, mees, I make dem dog
&rsquo;urry plenty moch. Yes, ma&rsquo;am, you bet!&rdquo;
he repeated, calmly, but looking at her with
the strong steely eyes that seemed peculiar to
these men of the great North.</p>
<p>He ran with his team up the path. When
he reached the tote-road the girl saw that he
had jumped on the sled, which was tearing
away to the southward.</p>
<p>Within the shack Mrs. Papineau busied
herself in many ways, placing things in order
and fussing about the stove, upon which she
had placed a pot containing more herbs she
had brought with her. Every few minutes
she interrupted her work in order to take another
look at Hugo. Once or twice Madge
saw a big tear roll down her fat cheeks, which
she swiftly wiped off with her sleeve. A little
later she managed to make the man swallow
some of her concoction. He appeared to
obey unconsciously, but when she spoke to
him he just babbled something which neither
of the women understood. Finally the
Frenchwoman sat down at the side of Madge,
snuffling a little, and began to whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big strong man one day,&rdquo; she commented,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; dis day seek an&rsquo; weak lak one leetle child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Eet is de way so strange of de Providence.
It look lak de good Lord make one fine man,
fines&rsquo; Heem can make&ndash;&ndash;a man as should get
de love of vomans an&rsquo; leetle children&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;
den Heem mak up his min&rsquo; for to tak heem
avay. An&rsquo; Heem good Lord know why, but
I tink I better pray. Maybe de good Lord
Heem &rsquo;ear an&rsquo; tink let heem lif a whiles yet,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the woman knelt down and repeated
prayers, for the longest time, speaking hurriedly
the invocations she had all her life,
known by heart, and ending each one with
the devout crossing of her breast. Then
Madge, for the first time in a very long while,
remembered words she had so often heard in
the little village church at home, which promised
that whenever two or three were gathered
together in the name of the Lord, He would
be among them. Yes, she had heard that assurance
often in the place of worship she
could now see so vividly, in which the open
windows, on summer days, let in the droning
of the bees and the scent of honeysuckle outside.
So she knelt beside the other woman
and began to pray also, haltingly, in words
that came well-nigh unbidden because they
were the call of a heart in sore travail which
had long forgotten how to pray for itself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
And it seemed as if the great Power above
must surely be listening.</p>
<p>Finally Mrs. Papineau rose. She was compelled
to go back home and see that the
children were fed. She promised she would
return in a short time. The doctor would certainly
not come before night, perhaps not even
until early morning, for he would be compelled
to make a journey on the train. Papineau
would wait for him, of course. As soon
as he had sent the message he would give the
dogs a good feed and they would be ready for
the return. Then when the doctor turned up,
Papineau would rush him to Roaring River,
and&ndash;&ndash;and if the Lord was willing he might
be able to do something, providing....</p>
<p>But she had to interrupt herself to wipe
away another big tear. She placed a hand
upon the girl&rsquo;s shoulder, seeking to encourage
her a little, and started off, her heavy footsteps
crackling over the snow. Then silence
came again, but for the hurried breathing
of the sick man and the occasional sighs of
Maigan, who refused food offered to him.</p>
<p>Madge forced herself to eat a little, dimly
realizing that for a time there might be need
of all her strength. After this she sat down
again, feeling crushed with the sense of her
helplessness and with the thought of the terribly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
long hours that must elapse before the
doctor could arrive.</p>
<p>Once Hugo seemed to awaken, as if from
a sleep. The hand that had lain so still
seemed to grope, searchingly, and she placed
her own upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you over&ndash;&ndash;all right&ndash;&ndash;to-morrow,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a pity, because&ndash;&ndash;because
you&rsquo;re so&ndash;&ndash;so good and kind, now,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;She&ndash;&ndash;she thinks I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m the dirt
under her feet. Ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;ain&rsquo;t you there,
Stefan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes searched the room for a moment.
Then, with a look of disappointment, his head
sagged down on the pillow again and he lay
quiet for a long time, till he began to mutter
words that were disconnected and meaningless
to her.</p>
<p>The noon hour came and went, with a glowing
sun that shone brightly over the snow and
tinted the mist from the great falls with the
colors of the rainbow. But Madge did not
see it, for within the little shack the panes
were dimmed by the frost. The stove crackled
and spat, with the sudden little explosions of
wood fires. Close to it one felt very warm
but the heat did not extend far, since the cold
seemed to be seeking ever to penetrate the
room, making its way beneath the door and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
through some of the chinked spaces between
the logs. It affected Madge now as a sort of
enemy, this cold that seemed to be on the
watch for victims. It was one of the things
that were always rising up in order to crush
struggling men and women.</p>
<p>Another hour elapsed, that had been
cruelly long, when Maigan suddenly leaped
up and stood before the door, with hair
bristling all over him and standing like a
ridge along his back. He scratched furiously
and looked back, as if demanding to be let
out, and kept up a long, ominous growl that
was very different from his usual bark.</p>
<p>Madge went to the door, feeling very uneasy.
She opened it, after slipping her hand
under Maigan&rsquo;s collar. Upon the tote-road
she saw a large sled that had been drawn by
a pair of strong, shaggy horses, which a man
was blanketing. From where she stood she
heard confused voices of men and women, all
of whom were strangers to her. They seemed
to be consulting together. Finally they came
down the path towards the shack, nine or ten
of them, walking slowly and looking grim
and unfriendly. Maigan was now barking
fiercely and Madge had to struggle with him
to prevent his dashing out towards them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Stefan Runs</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Philippe Papineau rode nearly all the way
on the toboggan, sparing the dogs only in
the hardest places on rising ground. The
animals had been well-fed on the previous
night and the trip around the trapping line
had not been a hard one. It represented but
a mere fifty miles or so, over which they had
only hauled one man&rsquo;s food in three days,
with his blankets and a small shelter-tent he
used when forced to stop away from one of
the small huts he had built on the line. In
fact, there had been little need of three dogs,
but Papineau had taken them because it kept
up their training. In the pink of condition,
therefore, the team bade fair to equal Stefan&rsquo;s
best performances.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was within sight of the
smokestack rising from Carcajou&rsquo;s sawmill
when he opened his eyes, widely. A pair of
horses was coming along the old road, drawing
a big sled. As the old lumber trail was
used only by dog-teams, as a rule, this surprised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
him. A moment later he clucked at his
dogs, which drew to one side, and the horses,
from whose shaggy bodies a cloud of steam
was rising, came abreast of him. The sled
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, Papineau!&rdquo; called one of
the men. &ldquo;Going in for provisions? Thought
you hauled in a barrel of flour last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; assented Philippe, non-committally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that fellow Ennis over to his shack?&rdquo;
asked McIntosh, the squaw-man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; repeated the settler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye happen to know whether there&rsquo;s
a&ndash;&ndash;a young &rsquo;ooman there too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat you vant wid dat gal?&rdquo; asked Papineau
this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just goin&rsquo; visitin&rsquo;, like,&rdquo; Pat Kilrea
informed him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure a fine day for a
ride in the country. And so that there young
&rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s been up there a matter o&rsquo; three-four
days, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink so,&rdquo; assented Philippe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know who she is?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Kilrea,
a severe looking and angular woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, heem gal is friend o&rsquo; Hugo,&rdquo; answered
the Frenchman, simply. &ldquo;Mebbe you
better no go to-day. Hugo heem seek. I got
to &rsquo;urry, so good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>He lashed his dogs on again, while Pat
cracked his whip and the party went on. Mrs.
Kilrea was looking rather horrified, thought
Sophy McGurn. Her turn was coming at
last. There would be a scene that would repay
her for her trouble, she gleefully decided.</p>
<p>As they went on at a steady pace, over a
road which none but horses inured to lumbering
could have followed without breaking a
leg or getting hopelessly stalled in deep snow,
Philippe hurried over to the station and got
Joe Follansbee to send a telegram. The
young man would have given a good deal to
have made one of the party but his official
duties detained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants a doctor?&rdquo; he asked, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; answered Papineau, impatiently.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t h&rsquo;ask so moch question, you fellar.
Jus&rsquo; telegraph quick now an&rsquo; h&rsquo;ask for answer
ven dat <i>docteur</i> he come, you &rsquo;ear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe looked at the Frenchman, intending to
resent his sharp orders, but thought better of
it. The small, square-built, wide-shouldered
man was not one to be trifled with. He was
known as a calm, cool sort of a chap with little
sense of humor, and the youth reflected that,
in this neck of the woods, it was best not to
trifle with men who were apt to end a quarrel
by fighting over an acre of ground and mauling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
one another until one or both parties were
utterly unrecognizable, even to their best
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back in about an hour and I expect
I&rsquo;ll have an answer,&rdquo; he told the Frenchman,
quite meekly.</p>
<p>The latter went into McGurn&rsquo;s store and
purchased some tobacco and a few needed
groceries. Suddenly he bethought himself of
Stefan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Heem
ought know right avay, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drove his team around to Stefan&rsquo;s
smithy but failed to find him. At the house
Mrs. Olsen told him that her husband had
gone out a half an hour ago. He would probably
be at Olaf Jonson&rsquo;s, at the other end of
the village. Thither drove Philippe and
found his man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Stefan, want for see you right
avay,&rdquo; said the trapper. &ldquo;Come &rsquo;long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Swede hastened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat it iss, Philippe?&rdquo; he asked, eyeing the
dogs expertly. &ldquo;Py de looks off tem togs I
tink you ban in some hurry, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh! I come to telegraph for de
<i>docteur</i>. Hugo heem &rsquo;urted h&rsquo;awful bad.
Look lak&rsquo; heem die, mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan bellowed out an oath and began running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
towards his house at a tremendous gait.
Papineau jumped on his toboggan and followed,
only catching up after they had gone a
couple of hundred yards. When they reached
Olsen&rsquo;s, the latter went in, shouted out the
news and came out again. With the help of
Papineau he hitched up his own great team
of five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tank you for lettin&rsquo; me know, Papineau,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I get ofer dere so tam qvick you
don&rsquo;t belief, I tank. So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old &rsquo;ard! &rsquo;Old &rsquo;ard!&rdquo; shouted the
Frenchman. &ldquo;Vat for you tink Pat Kilrea
an&rsquo; McIntosh, an&rsquo; Prouty an&rsquo; Kerrigan and
more, an&rsquo; also vomans is goin&rsquo; up dere to de
Falls? Dey say go visitin&rsquo;. Dey don&rsquo;t nevaire
go make visits before dat vay. An&rsquo; dey h&rsquo;ask
me all &rsquo;bout de <i>demoiselle</i>, de gal vat is up
dere, an&rsquo; I see Mis&rsquo; Kilrea an&rsquo; Kerrigan&rsquo;s
voman look one de oder in de face. Look
mean lak&rsquo; de devil, dem vomans! I dunno,
but I tink dey up to no good, dem crowd. If
I no have to stay for <i>docteur</i> I go right back
qvick. D&rsquo;ye tink dey vant ter bodder Hugo,
or de lady, Stefan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter swore again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If dey bodder &rsquo;em I tvists all dere necks
like chickens, I tank,&rdquo; he cried, excitedly.
&ldquo;How long ago did they leave?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, most a h&rsquo;our, now, I tink, and
dem&rsquo;s Kerrigan&rsquo;s horses, as is five year olds
an&rsquo; stronk lak&rsquo; de devil. Dey run good on de
five-mile flat, dey do, sure, an&rsquo; odder places
vhere snow is pack nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Stefan didn&rsquo;t answer. He
shouted at his team, that started on the run,
but Zeb Foraker&rsquo;s St. Bernard, who could
lick any dog in Carcajou singly, chanced to
leap over the garden fence and come at them.
In a moment a half dozen dogs were piled up
in a fight. Stefan stepped into the snarl. A
moment later he had the biggest animal, that
was supposed to weigh close to two hundred,
by the tail. With a wonderful heave he lifted
it up and swung it over his master&rsquo;s fence into
a leafless copper beach that graced the plot,
whence the animal fell to the ground, looking
dazed. It took several minutes to straighten
out the tangled traces and the leader was hopelessly
lame. He had to be taken out and left
at home. All the time Stefan&rsquo;s language
brought scared faces to the windows of neighboring
shacks. It was a good thing, probably,
that few people in Carcajou understood Swedish.
Still, from the sound of it they judged
that it must be something pretty bad. Finally
he was off again, lacking the smartest animal
in his team. The others, however, probably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
considered that this was no occasion for
further bad behavior and old Jennie, mother
of three of the bunch, led it without making
any serious mistakes.</p>
<p>For the life of him Stefan couldn&rsquo;t conceive
why anyone should want to bother
Hugo or the pretty lady. It was the very
strangeness and mystery of the thing that
aroused him. He never entertained the idea
that Papineau was mistaken. The Frenchman
was a fine smart fellow, one who loved
Hugo, and a man not given to idle notions or
to exaggeration. If he thought there was
something wrong this must be the case.</p>
<p>On a long upgrade he ran at the side of his
dogs, his great chest heaving at the tremendous
effort. On the level he rode, urging the
animals on and keeping his eyes on the tracks
of the horses and sleigh, while his strong stern
face seemed immovably frozen into an expression
of grim determination. Anyone
who touched his friend Hugo would have to
reckon with him, indeed. The man was one
of the few beings he cared for, like his wife
or the young ones. Such a friendship was a
possession, something he owned, a treasure he
would not be robbed of and was prepared to
defend, as he would have defended his little
hoard of money, the home he had built, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
the berserker fury of his ancestors. He was
conscious of his might, conscious that there
were few men on earth who could stand up
against him in the rough and tumble fighting
current in the far wilderness. He knew that
he could go through such a crowd as was
threatening his friend like a devastating cyclone
through a cornfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If dey&rsquo;s qviet un&rsquo; reasonable I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;urt
nobotty but yoost tell &rsquo;em git out of here, tarn
qvick,&rdquo; he projected. &ldquo;But if dem mens is
up to anything rough I hope dey says dere
prayers alretty, because I yoost bust &rsquo;em all
up, you bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The team was pulling hard, the breaths
coming out in swift little puffs from their
nostrils. Sometimes they walked, with
tongues hanging out, while again they trotted
easily, or, down the hills, galloped with the
long easy lope of their wolfish ancestors. And
Stefan calculated the speed the horses could
have made here, and again over there. By
the tracks he saw where they had trotted along
good ground, or toiled more slowly over rough
places. The man grinned when he came to
spots where they must have proceeded very
slowly with the heavy sleigh, and his brows
corrugated when he saw that they had speeded
up again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dey drive tern horses fast,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;Dey don&rsquo;t vant trafel dis road back in dark,
sure ting, to break dere necks. Dey vant make
qvick vork. But I ban goin&rsquo; some, too, you
bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was taking man&rsquo;s eternal pleasure in
swift motion, yet the anxiety remained with
him that he might not catch up with them before
they arrived. He knew that nothing
could take place if he were there a minute
before them. But if he was a minute late,
what then? When this idea recurred, his face
would take on its grim expression, the look
wherewith Vikings once struck terror among
their enemies. He hoped for the sake of that
crowd that he might not be late, as well as for
the good of his friend, for he would crush
them, the men at any rate, and send the women
trudging home, wishing they had never been
born.</p>
<p>In him the two individualities that make up
nearly every human being swung and seesawed.
The kind-hearted, helpful, considerate
man kept on surging upward, in the trust
that his arrival would avert all trouble. Then
this phase of his being would pass off and the
great primal creature would take its place
and come uppermost, with lustful ideas of
vengeance, visions in which everything was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
tinged with red, and then his great voice
would ring out in the still woods and the dogs
would pull desperately, with never a pause,
and the toboggan would slither and slide and
groan, and the crunching snow seemed to
complain, and the masses of snow suspended
to great hemlocks and firs dropped down suddenly,
with thuds that were like the echoes of
great smiting clubs.</p>
<p>When again he ran beside the dogs, in a
long pull uphill, the sense of personal effort
comforted him. He was doing something.
Once the toe of one of his snowshoes caught
in the snaky root of a big spruce and he fell
ponderously, without a word, and picked
himself up again. Dimly he was conscious
that it had injured him a little, but he scarcely
felt it. It was like some hurt received in the
heat and passion of battle, that a man never
really feels till the excitement has passed.
His team had kept on, galloping fast, but he
never called to them, knowing that harder
ground would presently slow them. And he
ran on, his great limbs appearing to possess
the strength of machinery wrought of steel
and iron, while his enormous chest hoarsely
drew in and cast forth great clouds. But he
was not working beyond his power, merely
getting the best he knew out of the thews that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
made him more efficient than most men, when
it came to the toil of the wilds. He knew
better than to play himself out so that he
would arrive exhausted and unable to contend
with the whole of his might. He was conscious
as he ran that he would arrive nearly
unbreathed and ready for any fray. And after
he had swept off the intruders he would look
upon the face of his friend, the man who for
months had shared food with him, and the
scented bedding of the woods, and the toil,
and the downpours, and the clouds of black
flies and mosquitoes, and who had always
smiled through fair days and foul, and who,
at the risk of his life, had saved him.</p>
<p>And that friendship was so strong that it
must help the sick man. How could one be
ill with a friend near by who had so much
strength to give away, such determination to
make all things well, such fierce power to
contend with all inimical things? He would
take him in his arms and bid him be of good
cheer and courage, and the man would respond,
would smile, would feel that strength
being added to his own, so that he would soon
be well again.</p>
<p>All this might be deepest folly, and was
not formulated as we have been compelled to
put it down in these pages. Rather it was but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
a simple trust, a faith based on love and hope,
a belief originating in the mind of one of a
nature so trusting and inclined to goodness
that until the last moment he would never believe
in the victory of powers of evil.</p>
<p>So Stefan caught up with his dogs again
and stepped on the toboggan, without stopping
them, and the great trunks of forest
giants seemed to slip by him swiftly, while
here and there, by dint of some formation of
hillside or gorge, his ears grew conscious of
the far-away roar of the great falls. From a
little summit he saw the cloud of rising vapor,
all of a mile away. At every turn he peered
ahead, keenly disappointed on each occasion,
for the party was not in sight. So he urged
the dogs faster. The big sleigh must surely
be just ahead, beyond the next turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if dey touch one hair of de head of
Hugo, den God pity dem!&rdquo; he cried out.</p>
<p>And the dogs ran on, more swiftly than
ever, breathing easily still in spite of the
nearly three hundred pounds of manhood
they drew, and the roar of the falls became
more distinct, while to the right, away down
below, the river swirled under the groaning
ice and sped past wildly, towards the east
and the south, as if seeking to save itself from
the embrace of the North.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>A Visit Cut Short</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Like the great majority of the denizens of
the wilderness, Maigan could be a steadfast
friend or a bitter enemy. He would readily
have given his life for the one and torn
the other asunder. Not being very far removed
from a wolfish ancestry he was necessarily
suspicious, intolerant at first of strangers
and prepared to use his clean and cutting
fangs at the shortest notice. But he was also
more cautious than the dog of civilization and
less apt to blurt his feelings right out. After
his first outburst he appeared to quiet down,
growling but a very little, very low, and stood
at the girl&rsquo;s side, watchful and ready for immediate
action.</p>
<p>Madge stood on the wooden step that had
been cleared of snow, in front of the little
door of rough planks. She watched the
people coming in Indian file down the path
that had been beaten down in the deep snow.
For a moment she had thought that they
might be bringing help, that miraculously a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
doctor had been found at once, that these
people were friends eager to help, to remove
the sick man to Carcajou and thence to some
hospital further down the railway line. But
such people would have cried out inquiries.
They would have come with some shout of
greeting. But these newcomers came along
without a word until their leader was but a
few yards away, when he stopped and looked
at the girl during a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Hugo Ennis?&rdquo; he finally asked,
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in the shack,&rdquo; replied the girl,
timidly. &ldquo;He is dreadfully ill and lying on
his bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was shot&ndash;&ndash;shot by accident, and now
I&rsquo;m afraid that he is going to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go in and see. We&rsquo;ll all go in.
We&rsquo;re mighty cold after that long ride.
Stand aside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you might go in,&rdquo; the girl told
him, still blocking the way, &ldquo;but the others
must not. I&ndash;&ndash;I won&rsquo;t allow him to be disturbed.
Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you understand me?
I&rsquo;m telling you that he&rsquo;s dying. I&ndash;&ndash;I won&rsquo;t
have him disturbed. And&ndash;&ndash;and who are
you? You don&rsquo;t look like a friend of his.
What&rsquo;s your purpose in coming here?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>The first feeling of timidity that had seized
her seemed to have left her utterly. There
remained to her but an instinct&ndash;&ndash;a will to
defend the man, to protect him from unwarranted
intrusion, and she spoke with authority.
But another of the visitors addressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re folks belongin&rsquo; to these townships,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;What we want to know is who you
are, and what right ye&rsquo;ve got to order us
about and say who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; in and who&rsquo;s to
keep out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his words caused her cheeks
to burn, but strangely enough she felt quite
calm and strong in her innocence of any evil,
and she answered quietly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Madge Nelson, if you want
to know, and I am here at this moment because
I am taking care of Mr. Ennis. I feel
responsible for his welfare and will continue
until he is better and able to speak for himself,
or&ndash;&ndash;or until he is dead. I repeat that one of
you may come in&ndash;&ndash;but no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that her manner impressed the
men to some extent, if not the three women
who crowded behind. One of the visitors
was scratching the back of his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a-here, Aleck, I reckon that gal is
talking sense, if Hugo&rsquo;s real bad like she says.
We ain&rsquo;t got no call to butt in an&rsquo; make him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
worse. I know when Mirandy was sick the
Doc he told me ter take a club if I had to, to
keep folks out. Let Pat Kilrea go in if he
wants to an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll stay outside an&rsquo; wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; said old man
Prouty.</p>
<p>Pat advanced, but Maigan began to growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, young &rsquo;ooman, I&rsquo;ll bash that dog&rsquo;s
head in if you don&rsquo;t keep him still,&rdquo; he said,
truculently. &ldquo;Keep a holt of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge pulled the dog back and quieted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good, Maigan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She entered the shack behind Pat Kilrea
and closed the door. In doing this she meant
no offense to the others, who didn&rsquo;t mind,
knowing that with a cold of some twenty below
people don&rsquo;t care for an excess of ventilation.
They stood, the men silently, the women
putting their heads together and whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she the brazen sassy thing?&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Kilrea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess she ain&rsquo;t no better&rsquo;n she should
be,&rdquo; opined Sophy, acidly, as she watched the
door keenly.</p>
<p>Pat Kilrea went to the bunk and for an instant
considered the sick man&rsquo;s face. Then
he scratched his head again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hugo!&rdquo; he finally called out.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with ye? Ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;ain&rsquo;t
tryin&rsquo; to hide behind a gal&rsquo;s skirts, are ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arm was seized from behind. The
girl&rsquo;s eyes flashed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know who you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;But if&ndash;&ndash;if you say such things
I&rsquo;ll turn that dog on you, so help me God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t reckon as I meant it,&rdquo; stammered
Pat. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;he does look turriple
sick, now me eyes is gettin&rsquo; used to the light.
Why, why don&rsquo;t you speak, man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sufferer on the bunk made no
answer save in some low fast words that were
disconnected and meaningless. Slowly, nearly
tenderly, Pat touched a hand that felt burning
hot and a forehead that was moist and clammy.
Then he turned to the girl again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he acknowledged.
&ldquo;Looks to me like he was done for.
What are ye goin&rsquo; to do for him? We&ndash;&ndash;we
didn&rsquo;t reckon to find nothin&rsquo; like this when
we come, though Papineau told us he were
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Papineau&rsquo;s errand was to telegraph
for the doctor,&rdquo; she replied, with a hand
pressed to her bosom. &ldquo;At&ndash;&ndash;at first, when I
heard you coming, I thought he had perhaps
arrived and&ndash;&ndash;and that you were intending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
to take him away. Do&ndash;&ndash;do you really think
he&rsquo;s going to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m scared it looks a good deal that
way. Of course we might be able to take him
in the sleigh, but&ndash;&ndash;but he don&rsquo;t look much as
if he could stand the trip&ndash;&ndash;does he?&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;
I don&rsquo;t reckon we can do much good
stayin&rsquo; round here either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped over to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gal&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hugo looks
desperate sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s ketchin&rsquo;, are
ye?&rdquo; asked his wife, drawing back a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t never hear that pistol bullets
was contagious,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who did it?&rdquo; cried McIntosh.
&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and how d&rsquo;ye know &rsquo;twas just an
accident. Seems to me we&rsquo;d ought to find
out something more about it. It&ndash;&ndash;it don&rsquo;t
sound just natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you he was shot by accident. I did
it, God forgive me,&rdquo; faltered Madge.</p>
<p>Sophy McGurn, at this, pushed her way
forward until she stood in front of Madge,
and pointed an accusing finger at her. Her
eyes were flashing. To Maigan her move
seemed a threatening one and she recoiled as
the animal crouched a little, with fangs bare
and lips slavering.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him, miss, hold him quick!&rdquo; cried
Aleck Mclntosh. &ldquo;Git back there, Sophy,
what&rsquo;s the matter with ye? D&rsquo;ye want to be
torn to pieces? What&rsquo;s that ye was goin&rsquo; to
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&ndash;&ndash;she never shot him by accident!
She&ndash;&ndash;she did it on purpose, for revenge,
that&rsquo;s what she did, the she-devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still standing before Madge and
her voice was shaking with excitement, while
her arms and hands trembled with her passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo; cried Pat Kilrea. &ldquo;Ye
wasn&rsquo;t here to see, was ye? How d&rsquo;ye know
she done it a-purpose, for revenge? Ye must
have some reason for sayin&rsquo; such things. Out
with &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Sophy was shrinking back, afraid
of her own outburst, fearing that she might
have revealed something. Her voice shook
again as she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I ain&rsquo;t got any reason,&rdquo; she stammered.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I was just thinking so. It&ndash;&ndash;it
came to me all of a sudden. Maybe I&rsquo;m
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistaken, was it?&rdquo; asked Pat Kilrea.
&ldquo;Folks ain&rsquo;t got any right to be mistaken
when it comes to accusin&rsquo; others of murder.
If you hadn&rsquo;t had some reason to speak that
way ye&rsquo;d have kept yer mouth shut, I&rsquo;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
thinking. Why don&rsquo;t ye come right out with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t really mean anything by it,&rdquo;
stammered Sophy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What revenge was that you was referring
to?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing at all. How should
I know what she would do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to have kept still an&rsquo; held
yer tongue,&rdquo; said Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems to me as if we&rsquo;d ought to investigate
this thing a little,&rdquo; ventured Prouty.
&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got anythin&rsquo; here but this &rsquo;ere
young &rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s word for what&rsquo;s happened.
She can tell us how it came about, anyways,
seems to me, and we can judge if it sounds
sensible and correct like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; put in Kilrea. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
fair and proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly willing to tell you all I
know about it,&rdquo; asserted Madge, quietly. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I
came here to see Mr. Ennis on a matter
that&ndash;&ndash;that concerns us only. And I had
occasion to open my bag. Among the things
in it there was a revolver. It fell out of my
hands and exploded, and&ndash;&ndash;and the bullet
struck him. I&ndash;&ndash;I never knew that he had
been shot. He never even told me, and then
he hitched the dog to the sleigh and took me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
over to Mrs. Papineau&rsquo;s, where I have been
staying. And it was she who discovered that
he had been injured. She&rsquo;ll tell you so herself
if you go to her. And&ndash;&ndash;and he told her
it was an accident, as he would tell you now if&ndash;&ndash;if
he wasn&rsquo;t dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d fixed it up to spend the night at
Papineau&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Kilrea, who had
hitherto kept somewhat in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the arrangement we had made,&rdquo;
answered the girl. &ldquo;There was no other
place where I could stay. But I&rsquo;d have gone
up there alone if I&rsquo;d known how badly he was
hurt. I&rsquo;ve stayed with them ever since, of
course, for there was no one to take me back.
Mr. Papineau hadn&rsquo;t returned. He was
trapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but what she must be tellin&rsquo;
the truth,&rdquo; opined Mrs. Kilrea. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
anything wrong or improper in all this, savin&rsquo;
a girl handlin&rsquo; a revolver, which ain&rsquo;t wise.
We can go over to Papineau&rsquo;s and make sure
it&rsquo;s just as she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing ain&rsquo;t clear,&rdquo; said
Pat Kilrea. &ldquo;What business did she come
on, anyways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge drew herself up and looked at him
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you that this concerns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Mr. Ennis and myself,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;and I
deny that you have any right....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there was a roar from the tote-road
as big Stefan, lashing his dogs, bumped
down the path at a wild gallop and, a minute
later, threw himself off the sled and was
among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do, peoples?&rdquo; he shouted, advancing
truculently towards Pat and Mclntosh.
&ldquo;Papineau telt me as how Hugo he get hurted
bad and sick. And he say you peoples ask
him whole lot qvestions about him. I vant
to know vhat all you is doin&rsquo; here, und&ndash;&ndash;und
if I ain&rsquo;t satisfied I take some of you and&ndash;&ndash;and
vipe up de ground vid you, hear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was ominously calm, but his
words sent a shiver through the crowd. He
was and looked a tremendous figure. He had
moved to the side of the girl, as if to defend
her, and his clear blue eyes went searchingly
from one man to the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papineau he tells me in Carcajou it look
like you come ofer here to make drouble for
Hugo an&rsquo; mebbe for dis young leddy. So I
come here fast like my togs can take me, sure
ting. Und I vant to know vhen you vants to
start droubles. Der leddies can move leetle
vay to one side if dey like, to make room. Ve
need plenty, I tank. Who vant to start de
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
row now, who begin? I tak&rsquo; you vun at a time
or altogedder, how you like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a step forward and the men all
moved back hurriedly. The ladies had
swiftly accepted his advice and were retreating
fast, now and then looking back in terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Stefan, what are you butting
in for?&rdquo; Kilrea took courage to ask while
he kept discreetly out of reach. &ldquo;We came
to see if everything was all right and proper
here. We&rsquo;re satisfied now and are going
back. Got to hurry away, sun&rsquo;s getting low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Swede sniffed at him contemptuously,
and drew off a big mitt of muskrat hide.
With some difficulty he drew from his clothing
a huge silver watch and looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you vas in a hurry. I tank I &rsquo;elp
you a bit make tings lifely. I gif you all yoost
tree minutes ter get started. Den if any man
he ain&rsquo;t aboard dat sleigh I yoost vipes up de
ground vit him a bit. If you knows vhat is
good for ye, den make tracks, qvick. I ban
gettin&rsquo; hurry mineself, eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what right have you to be ordering
us about?&rdquo; shouted Aleck Mclntosh, imprudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My frient, you&rsquo;s knowed as de laziest
man in Carcajou and some say in Ontario. I
helps you along, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>He had dashed towards him with devastating
speed. The fellow turned to run, but a
second later the slack of some of his garments
was in Stefan&rsquo;s huge hand. Struggling and
backing he found himself half lifted, half
propelled on the ground, all the way to the
sled. There he was lifted high and dumped
in, like a bag of feed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any oders as need help?&rdquo; roared Stefan.</p>
<p>But they were hastening for all they were
worth. Kilrea took the reins. The three
women were already seated. The others
jumped in and the horses started home again,
even before the Carcajou Vigilantes had
finished spreading robes over their shaky
knees. Striking a bit of flat bare rock, the
runners spat out fire and squealed, after which
the heavy sled slithered and slipped over the
crackling snow, so that presently the outfit
disappeared around the first bend in the tote-road.</p>
<p>Miss Sophy McGurn looked particularly
down-hearted. None of the interesting events
she expected had taken place. She had
merely succeeded in nearly giving herself
away and arousing suspicions.</p>
<p>And the girl was still there, with Hugo!
She had believed that Hugo would be found
sheepish and embarrassed, or in a regular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
fury, while the stranger would weep and
wring her hands and seek to explain. And
the invading crowd was to have manifested
its indignation at this breach of all decency
and proper custom, and sent the woman away,
while they would have told the man what they
thought of him, in spite of his rage, and
warned him that he must mend his ways or
quit the country.</p>
<p>And now they had all been driven away,
and that girl had stood and spoken as if she
had some right to be there, and had been indignant
at any inquiry into her motives for
coming to Roaring River. Worse than all
Pat Kilrea and his wife seemed to have turned
against her, after absolving the two of blame.</p>
<p>She shrank back, drawing her fur cap
further down over her eyes and ears. Now
the cold seemed more bitter than she had ever
felt it before, in spite of the thermometer&rsquo;s
rise, and the road was so long and dreary that
it seemed as if it never would end.</p>
<p>And Hugo Ennis was dying&ndash;&ndash;and in her
heart Sophy McGurn felt certain that the girl
had shot to kill, and was waiting there until
he should die. Perhaps she had rummaged
about the place and found money or other
valuables, for Ennis always seemed to have
some funds, though he spent prudently and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
carefully, and never seemed to have dollars to
throw away. And the end of it would be that
the girl would leave and the man would be
dead and all the dreams of marriage first and
of a revenge following had turned into this
thing, which was a nightmare.</p>
<p>She reached her home half frozen, in spite
of the robes, and could not eat her food. Her
mother had a few mild words to say about
long excursions out in the back country, in this
sort of weather. Then the girl left the table
suddenly, and slammed the door of her room
shut, in a towering rage. A little later, after
she had lain down, came tears, for it seemed
to her at this time that she had never truly
loved Ennis until she heard that he was dying,
and now he was lost to her forever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Help Comes</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Stefan had watched the departure of those
people grimly, until he felt sure that they
would not return. Madge had stood near
him. In her desolation it was splendid to
have him there with her, to be no longer
obliged to stare at the sick man&rsquo;s face in lonely
terror, to feel that if there was any help
needed he would be at hand, with all his immense
strength and courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tank dey don&rsquo;t mean much badness,&rdquo;
the man explained to her. &ldquo;Mebbe ye knows
peoples in dis countree ain&rsquo;t much to do in dis
vintertime and dey gets fonny iteas about
foolin&rsquo; araount. Dey goes home all qviet
now, you bet, and don&rsquo;t talk to nobotty vhat
tam fools dey bin, eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both entered the shack again and the
big fellow went up to the bunk upon which
lay his friend. For a very long time he looked
at him, finally touching a hand with infinite
care and gentleness. After this he turned to
Madge a face expressive of deepest pain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Leetle leddy,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;vos it
true as you shot him? Papineau he telt me
so. A accident, he said it vos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him imploringly, with
elbows bent but hands stretched towards him,
as if she were suing for forgiveness. The
man was seated on a stool, waiting for her
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was an accident&ndash;&ndash;a terrible accident,&rdquo;
sobbed Madge, whose strength and
courage seemed to leave her suddenly. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you
believe me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hard to say whether it was weakness
or the excess of her emotion that forced her
down to her knees. She grasped one of the
huge hands the man had extended towards
her. He laid the other upon her bent back,
very softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course I do, you poor leetle leddy.
Yes, I sure beliefe you. Dere vosn&rsquo;t anybotty
vould hurt Hugo, unless dey vos grazy, you
bet. He ban a goot friend to me&ndash;&ndash;ay, he
ban a goot friend to all peoples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He helped her up, very tenderly, and made
her sit on a stool close to the one he occupied.
There was a very long interval of silence, during
which his great face and beard were
hidden in the hollow of his hands. Then
he spoke again, in a very low voice, as if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
had been addressing the smallest of his own
babes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor leetle leddy,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I
feels most turriple sorry for Hugo, for it most
tear my heart out yoost to look at him. But
vhen I looks at you I feels turriple sorry for
you too. I knows vhat it must be, sure ting,
for a leetle leddy like you to be sittin&rsquo; here,
in dis leetle shack, a-lookin&rsquo; at de man she
lofe an see de life goin&rsquo; out of him. Last fall
Hugo ban gone a vhiles back East again, and
vhen you comes I tank mebbe you some nice
gal he promise to marry. Even vhen de telegraft
come I make sure it is so. I pring de bit
paper here myself an&rsquo; vaits a vhiles, but he no
come and I haf to go on. I vanted to see de
happy face on him. I say to myself, &lsquo;Hah!
You rascal Hugo, you nefer tell nodding to
your ole friend Stefan, but he know all de
same.&rsquo; But vhen I got to go I couldn&rsquo;t
say nodding. I leaf de paper on de table
here an&rsquo; I tank how happy he is vhen he
come home an&rsquo; find it. You poor leetle
leddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was mistaken, most honestly so,
for no idea of love had ever entered Hugo&rsquo;s
head, and none had come to Madge. Yet the
big fellow&rsquo;s words seemed to stab the girl to
the heart and she moaned. She felt that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
could not allow Hugo&rsquo;s friend to remain undeceived.
There had been already too many
mysteries, too many lies&ndash;&ndash;she would have no
share in them if she could help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I wasn&rsquo;t in love with him when I
came, Stefan,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;he was
a stranger to me. I had never seen him&ndash;&ndash;never
in all my life. I came here because&ndash;&ndash;because
there has been some terrible mistake&ndash;&ndash;in
some letters, queer letters that bade me
come here and&ndash;&ndash;and meet a man who wanted
a wife. And I&ndash;&ndash;I was a poor miserable sick
girl in New York and&ndash;&ndash;and I just couldn&rsquo;t
keep body and soul together anymore&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and
be a good decent girl. And those letters
seemed so beautiful that I felt I must
come and see the man who wrote them, and&ndash;&ndash;and
I was ready to marry him if he would be
kind to me and&ndash;&ndash;and treat me decently and&ndash;&ndash;and
keep me from starvation and suffering.
And when I came here he didn&rsquo;t know anything
about it, and&ndash;&ndash;and I thought he lied.
But&ndash;&ndash;but I never thought to do him any
harm. I took the little pistol out of the bag,
because I was looking for something else, and
it went off! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hid her face in her hands, as if the
whole scene had been again enacted before
her, and the man heard her sobbing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo he nefer tell no lie,&rdquo; said Stefan,
softly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know vhat all dis mean, you
bet. But I am glad you ban come like a
stranger. I am glad he no lofe you, and den
I am sorry, too, for you so nice gal, vid voice
so soft and such prettee eyes, I tank if he lofe
you den you sure lofe him too. Den you two
so happy in dis place, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted himself, striking his fist
upon his chest, as if to still a pain in it, and
went on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haf no idea how prettee place dis is,
leetle leddy, in de summertime. A vonderful
place to be happy in. De big falls dey make
music all day and at night dey sings you to
sleep, like de modder she sings leetle babies.
Und de big birches dey lean ofer, so beautiful,
and de birds dey comes all rount, nesting in
all de bushes. Oh, such a vonderful place
for a man and a voman to love, dem falls of
dat Roaring Rifer! Hugo he cleared such a
goot piece, oder side of dat leetle hill, vhere
de oats vould grow fine. And down by de
Rifer, on de north side, he find silver, plenty
silver in big veins, like dey got east of us, in
Nipissing countree. So I tank one day he
ban a rich man and haf a prettee little voman
and plenty nice kiddies, leetle children like
one lofes to see, and dey all lif here so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>His voice grew suddenly hoarse. It was
with an effort that he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now he don&rsquo; know me&ndash;&ndash;or you or
Maigan, and&ndash;&ndash;and my goot dear frient Hugo
he look like he ban dyin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan stopped abruptly again, apparently
overcome. His face, tanned by frost and sun
to a hue of dull brick, also lay in the hollow
of his hands. The vastness of his grief seemed
to be commensurate with his size. But when
he looked up Madge saw that his eyes were
dry, for he was suffering according to the way
of strong men with the agony that clutches at
the breast and twists a cord about the temples.
In his helplessness before the peril he was
pitiful to see, since all his confidence had gone,
his pride in his power, his faith in his ability
to surmount all things by the mere force of
his will. And the present weakness of the
man augmented the girl&rsquo;s own sorrow, even
though his being there was relief of a sort.</p>
<p>The Swede looked about him vaguely, and
then his eyes became fixed on a point of the
log wall, as if through it he had been able to
discern things that lay beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo an&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he began again, very
slowly and softly, &ldquo;ve vent off north from
here, a year an&rsquo; a half it is now, after de ice
she vent off de lakes. And ve trafel long vays,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
most far as vhere de Albany she come down
in James Bay. Ve vos lookin&rsquo; for silfer an&rsquo;
copper an&rsquo; tings like dat. An&rsquo; dere come one
day vhen ve gets awful rough water on a lake
and ve get upset. Him Hugo he svim like a
otter, he do, but me I svim like a stone. De
shore he ban couple hundret yard off, mebbe
leetle more. I hold on to de bow and Hugo
he grab de stern. So he begin push for shore,
svimmin&rsquo; vid his feet, but dat turriple slow
going, vid de canoe all under vater, yoost
holdin&rsquo; us up a bit, and it vos cold, awful turriple
cold in dat vater. He calls to me ve can&rsquo;t
make it dat vay, ve don&rsquo;t make three-four
yards a minute. Den I calls for him to let
go, for I ban tanking he safe his life anyvay,
svimmin&rsquo; ashore vhere ve had our camp close
by. Und vhat you tank he do, ma&rsquo;am? He
yell to me not be tam fool, dat vhat he do!
He say, &lsquo;How I look at your voman an&rsquo; de
kids in de face, vhen I gets back vidout you?&rsquo;
So he lets go and my end sink deep so I let go
an&rsquo; vos fighting to keep up but he grab me
and say to take holt of his shoulter. He swear
he trown vid me if I don&rsquo;t. So I done it,
ma&rsquo;am, and he svim, svim turriple hard,
draggin&rsquo; me ashore. I yoost finds my feet on
de bottom vhen he keels ofer, like dead, vid
de cold and de playin&rsquo; out. So I takes him in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
my arms and runs in. I had matches in my
screw-box but my fingers vos dat froze I
couldn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em out first. But I manages
make a fire, by an&rsquo; by, and I rubs de life back
into him again. And&ndash;&ndash;and you know vhat
is first ting he say vhen he vake up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him Hugo yoost say, &lsquo;Now I kin look
Mis&rsquo; Olsen in de face, vhen ve gets back, eh,
old pard?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man kept still again, looking anxiously
at the sufferer and watching the hurried
breathing. The feeling of his uselessness was
evidently a torture to him, but his heart was
too full for him to remain silent very long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now I am here an&rsquo; can do nodings.
I ban no more use dan&ndash;&ndash;dan de tog dere.
My God, leddy, tell me vhat I can do! He
most trown himself an&rsquo; freeze to death to safe
me dat time an&rsquo; I got sit still like a big tam
fool an&rsquo; him goin&rsquo; under vidout a hand to pull
him out. All de blood in my body, every
drop, I gif to safe him. Don&rsquo;t you beliefe?
I remember vhen de vaves and de vind pring
dot canoe ashore. Ve lose not a ting because
eferyting is lashed tight. Py dat time he vos
vhistling and singin&rsquo; alretty, like nodings efer
happen. Ve had de big fire roarin&rsquo;, I tell
you, and vhen I say again he safe my life he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
yoost laugh like it is a fine yoke an&rsquo; say: &lsquo;Oh,
shut up, Stefan, ve&rsquo;re a pair big fools to
get upset, anyvays. And some tay you do
yoost same ting for me, I bet.&rsquo; And now&ndash;&ndash;now
I can do nodings&ndash;&ndash;nodings at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to be in an agony of despair.
Madge had hardly realized that the suffering
of men could reach such an intensity. She
rose and placed her little hand on the giant&rsquo;s
shoulder. The huge frame was shaking convulsively,
in great sobs that brought no tears
with them. Then, all at once, he rose and
faced her, shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor leetle leddy,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;I ban
makin&rsquo; you unhappy vid dem story. I ban
sorry be such a big tam fool, but I can no
help it. It&ndash;&ndash;it is stronger as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time he paced up and down the little
shack, struggling hard to keep himself in
hand. Once he seized his shaggy head in his
great paws and seemed to be trying to squeeze
out of it the unendurable pain that was in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De sun he begin go town,&rdquo; he said, stopping
suddenly. &ldquo;Vhy don&rsquo;t dat Papineau
get back? It get dark soon. I tank I take
de togs an&rsquo; go down de road. Mebbe his team
break down. His leader ban a young tog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Madge felt like begging him
to remain. Ay, she could have shrieked out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
her terror at the idea of being left alone with
the man that was dying, as she thought, but
she also succeeded in controlling herself,
realizing that if the man was not allowed to
do something, anything that would require
the strength of his thews and divert the turmoil
of his brain, he might go mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As&ndash;&ndash;as you think best,&rdquo; she assented,
with her head bent low.</p>
<p>Stefan took his cap and fitted it over his
great shock of hair, but at this moment
Maigan rose and went to the door, whining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one ban comin&rsquo;, but it ain&rsquo;t Papineau,&rdquo;
said Stefan.</p>
<p>It proved to be Mrs. Papineau, hurrying
down the path and carrying a basket. She
explained that the cow had had a calf, hence
her delay. Puffing and breathless she scolded
them for not lighting the lamp and bustled
about the place, declaring that the two watchers
should have made tea and that it took an
experienced mother of many to know how to
handle things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made strong soup vid moose-meat,&rdquo;
she told them. &ldquo;Heem do Monsieur Hugo
moch good. I put on de stove now an&rsquo; get
hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke confidently, just as usual, as if
nothing out of the ordinary were going on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
in the shack, but it was a transparent effort
to encourage the others, and she was not able
to keep it up long. She happened to look at
Hugo again, and suddenly her face fell and
her hands went up, while she buried her face
in her blue apron and sobbed right out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De good Lord Heem bring an&rsquo; de good
Lord Heem take away,&rdquo; was what she said,
and it sounded like a knell in the ears of the
others.</p>
<p>Since the light was beginning to fail Madge
lit the little lamp. Mrs. Papineau took some
of the soup out of the pot and stirred it with a
spoon to cool it, and then she lifted the sick
man&rsquo;s head. Her voice became soft and
caressing, as if she had spoken to a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My leetle Hugo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;dere&rsquo;s a
good fellar. Try an&rsquo; drink, jus&rsquo; one bit.
H&rsquo;open mouth, dat way. Now you swallow,
dere&rsquo;s good boy. An&rsquo; now you try heem
again, jus&rsquo; one more spoon. H&rsquo;it is awful
good, from de big moose what Philippe he
get. Jus&rsquo; one more spoon an&rsquo; I not bodder
you no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Hugo understood or not no one
could have told. At any rate, with infinite
patience, she was able to feed him a little,
until he finally pushed her hand away from
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>Stefan, whose back had been resting on the
door and whose arms had been hanging dejectedly
at his side, took a step towards the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay go down de road a bit an&rsquo; meet Papineau
if he come back,&rdquo; he proposed. &ldquo;If de
togs is tired I take de doctor on my toboggan.
Get back qvicker dat vay. So long! I comes
back soon anyvays, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started away at a swift pace, his strong
dogs, amply rested, barking and throwing
themselves hard upon the breastpieces of their
harness. After he was out of hearing the two
women sat very close together, for mutual
comfort and consolation, and the older one
began to speak in a low whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You very lucky, mademoiselle. It ees
lucky it ain&rsquo;t you h&rsquo;own man as lie dere an&rsquo;
you haf to see heem like dat. It is turriple
ting to see. One time Papineau heem get
h&rsquo;awful seek, an&rsquo; I watch him five&ndash;&ndash;no, six
day and de nights. An&rsquo; it vos back in de
Grand Nord, no doctor nor noding at all.
An&rsquo; me wid my little Justine jus&rsquo; two month
ole in my h&rsquo;arms. An&rsquo; den come de day ven
de good Lord Heem &rsquo;ear &rsquo;ow I pray all de
time an&rsquo; Papineau heem begin to get vell
again. But de time vos like having big knife
planted in my &rsquo;eart, jus&rsquo; like dat.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>She made a gesture as if she had stabbed
herself, and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not know &rsquo;ow &rsquo;appy you must be you
no love a man as goin&rsquo; for die soon. You&ndash;&ndash;you
go crazy times like dat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Madge made no answer and could only
continue to stare at the form that seemed to
grow dimmer as the small oil lamp cast flickering
shadows in the room. In her ears the
continued, eternal sound of the great falls had
taken on an ominous character. It was like
some solemn dirge that rose and fell, unaccountably,
like the breathing of a vast force
that could reck nothing of the piteous tragedy
being enacted. It appeared to be growing
ever so much colder again. A few feet away
from the stove it was freezing. She sought to
look out of the little window but great massing
clouds had hidden the crimson of sunset. A
strong wind was arising and caused the great
firs and spruces to groan dismally. The minutes
were again becoming cruel things that
tortured one with their maddening slowness.
The girl became conscious of the beats of her
heart, unaccountably slow, as she thought.</p>
<p>And then, for a moment, that heart stopped
utterly. A shout had come from the little
lumber road and Maigan was barking at the
door excitedly, in spite of the older woman&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
scolding. The toboggan slithered over the
snow and there was a patter of dogs&rsquo; feet.</p>
<p>Madge threw the door open and let in a
man in a great coonskin coat, who was carrying
a bag. In spite of the heaviest fur mitts
his hands were chilled and for a moment he
held them to the glow of the stove, before
turning calmly to his patient, after a curt nod
to each of the women.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dr. Starr,&rdquo; the man introduced himself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s turning mighty cold again. We only
hit the high places after I got on Stefan&rsquo;s
toboggan, I can tell you. How the man kept
up with his team I can&rsquo;t tell you, but he ran
all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw off his heavy coat and turned to
the bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see what we&rsquo;ve got here,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The two women were scanning his face,
holding their breaths, but Mrs. Papineau had
the lamp and held it so as to cast some light
on Hugo. The doctor&rsquo;s expression, however,
was quite inscrutable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband?&rdquo; he asked the girl, who
shook her head. &ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s a good
thing he&rsquo;s not. Put a lot of water to boil on
the stove, please. Can&rsquo;t you find another lamp
here&ndash;&ndash;this one doesn&rsquo;t give much light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no lamp but they found a package
of candles which were soon flickering on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
the table, stuck in the necks of bottles. The
doctor was pulling a lot of things out of his
bag, coolly. To Madge it seemed queer that
he could be so unaffected by what he saw.
Presently he went to work, after baring the
injured shoulder.</p>
<p>After it was all over it seemed to the girl
like some dreadful nightmare. After just one
keen glance the doctor had probably decided
that her young hands would afford him the
better help. And so she had been obliged to
remain at his side and look upon the sinewy
shoulder and the arm that had been laid bare,
and at the angry and inflamed wound which
had been flooded with iodine. And then had
come the picking up of shining instruments
just taken out of one of the boiling vessels.
Her teeth left imprints on her lips and she
felt that she was surely going to stagger and
fall as the man made long slashing incisions.
From them he took out a piece of cloth and a
bullet that had been flattened against the bone.
After this there was a lot more disinfecting
and the placing of red tubes of rubber deep
down in the wound, which was finally covered
with a large dressing. But it was only after
this was all finished that Madge dropped on a
stool, feeling sick and shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not such a very bad soldier,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
after all,&rdquo; commented the doctor, quietly, as
he gathered up his instruments to clean and
boil them again. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m optimistic
about this case&ndash;&ndash;but perhaps you
don&rsquo;t quite understand such big words. I
mean that I haven&rsquo;t any great hopes for this
lad, but at least he has some little chance now.
There was none whatever before. Of course
it depends a lot on the nursing he gets. If I
thought for a moment that he could stand the
trip I&rsquo;d take him away with me, but that&rsquo;s
out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned to Stefan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to catch the first freight back in
the morning, my man. Will you take me to
Carcajou in good time? I can&rsquo;t afford to
miss it. Too many needing me just now east
of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I take you&ndash;&ndash;if Hugo he no worse.
But if tings is goin&rsquo; wrong, I&rsquo;ll let Papineau
do it. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t leaf no more. Vhen I
starts from here I tank I can&rsquo;t stand it a moment&ndash;&ndash;but
vhen I get off on de road, I gets
grazy to come back. I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know vhat I
vants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor looked at him curiously, appreciating
the depth of the man&rsquo;s emotion and
gauging the strength of the superb creature
he was.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you take me if it isn&rsquo;t safe,&rdquo;
he told him, and turned to his patient again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to stay up all night?&rdquo; he
suddenly asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I am anxious to, if I can be of the
slightest help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can never tell,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I might
be glad to have you with me. You don&rsquo;t lose
your head&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re efficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Papineau arrived with his dogs
and took his wife home. The good lady had
looked upon the doctor&rsquo;s cutting with profound
disfavor. A suggestion of hers about
herbs had been treated with scant respect.
Before leaving she spoke to Madge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay h&rsquo;all night too&ndash;&ndash;but it ain&rsquo;t no
good, because if he lif to-morrow night den
you go sleep an&rsquo; I stay &rsquo;ere. Before I go to
bed I prays moch. I&ndash;&ndash;I &rsquo;opes he lif through
de night&ndash;&ndash;heem no more bad as heem was,
anyvays, an&rsquo; dat someting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went away sorrowfully, to the little
new-born calf and the babies and the children
who needed them, and Stefan sat on the floor
with his back to the wall, while Maigan
snuggled up against him.</p>
<p>Dr. Starr remained all night, sometimes
dozing a little on his chair, with the ability of
the man often called at night to take little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
snatches of sleep here and there, but Madge
was at all times wide awake. Some time after
midnight Hugo appeared to be sleeping
quietly. The valuable candles had been extinguished,
of course, but the little lamp was
burning, shaded on one side by a piece of
birch bark. Stefan had gradually curled up
on the floor, under the table, where he was
out of the way, and was snoring lustily. In
the morning, doubtless, he would most honestly
insist that he had not slept an instant.
Out of doors the Swede&rsquo;s dogs had dug holes
in the snow and, with sensitive noses covered
by their bushy tails, were awaiting in slumber
the next call from their master. The great
falls kept up their moan and the trees swayed
and cracked. A wind-borne branch, falling
on the roof, made a sudden racket that was
startling.</p>
<p>At frequent intervals Madge rose and gave
Hugo some water, for which he always
seemed grateful, or adjusted the pillow beneath
his head. Once, when she sat down
again, she saw the doctor&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon
her, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the necessary instinct,&rdquo; he told
her, &ldquo;and the patience and perseverance. I
don&rsquo;t know what your plans may be for the
future, but you would make a good nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Madge shrugged her shoulders, the tiniest
bit. She didn&rsquo;t know. It didn&rsquo;t matter
what she was fit for. The world so far had
been a failure. The only important thing
before her now was to do her best to help pull
the sick man out of the jaws of death, if it
could possibly be done. She sat down again,
and after a time that seemed like an age the
utter blackness without began to turn to gray
and, in spite of the constantly replenished
stove, the chill of the early morning struck
deep into her. As the doctor looked at his
watch she rose and began to make tea, which
comforted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to keep on looking after
this man?&rdquo; the doctor asked her, abruptly,
between two mouthfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, if I may,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say that you will simply have to,
if his life is to be saved, or at least if he&rsquo;s to
have a fair chance. I shall be compelled to
go pretty soon. As it is I won&rsquo;t get back home
before noon and there are several bad cases I
must see to-day. I&rsquo;ll return the day after to-morrow;
it&rsquo;s the best I can do, for it is absolutely
impossible for me to remain here. Now
just listen to me very carefully while I give
you the necessary directions. I think I&rsquo;d
better write some of them out so that you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
be sure not to forget them. See if you can
find me a bit of paper somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one of the shelves there was a small
homemade desk in which she rummaged.
She found a number of loose bits of paper,
some of them scribbled over in pencil and
others with ink. They were apparently accounts,
notes concerning various supplies and
a few letters from various places. Finding a
clean sheet she brought it to the doctor who
rapidly wrote at length upon it. At this
moment Stefan awoke, with a portentous
yawn, but a second later he had leaped to his
feet and was scanning their faces anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tank mebbe I doze for a moment,&rdquo; he
informed them. &ldquo;How is Hugo gettin&rsquo;
long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present he looks to me somewhat
better,&rdquo; answered the doctor. &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be any immediate danger, and I&rsquo;ll
have to start back in a few minutes. We&rsquo;ve
had a cup of tea, but you&rsquo;d better make some
breakfast ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefan bestirred himself and presently a
potful of rolled oats was being stirred carefully
for fear of burning, and bacon was sputtering
in the pan. The kettle was singing
again and Madge was cutting slices from a
loaf left by Mrs. Papineau. The three sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
down to the table and ate hungrily, abundantly,
as people have to who make stern demands
upon their vitality.</p>
<p>The doctor made a few more remarks about
the treatment of his patient. He had carefully
laid on the table the little tablets of
medicine, the bottle containing an antiseptic,
the cotton and gauze that must be used to renew
the dressing. Then he went out, breathing
deeply of the sharp and aromatic air, and
a moment later he and Stefan were gone, the
latter promising to return at once, with a few
needed supplies from the store. Madge was
alone now with Hugo, who was again sleeping
quietly. She read over the doctor&rsquo;s directions
carefully while she stood by the little
window, as the lamp had been extinguished.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she decided to place
the paper in the little desk again, for safe-keeping.
Without the slightest curiosity her
eyes fell again upon some of the writing on
loose sheets. But presently she was staring at
it hard as a strong conviction made its way
into her brain. After this she went to the
other shelf where some books had been placed
and opened one of them, and then another.
On the flyleaf was written, in bold characters,
&ldquo;Hugo Ennis.&rdquo; The writing was exactly
the same as that which appeared on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
scattered leaves, for she compared them
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no doubt&ndash;&ndash;he never wrote
those letters,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but I
knew very well he couldn&rsquo;t have written
them. It&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea came again that he could have
obtained some one to write for him, but it
was immediately cast aside. The man would
not engage in dirty work himself&ndash;&ndash;far less
would he get others to do it for him. She&ndash;&ndash;she
had abused and insulted him&ndash;&ndash;called
him a liar, as far as she could remember, and
again her face felt hot and burning.</p>
<p>Once more she sat down by the bunk, after
she had given Maigan a big feed of oats,
with a small remnant of the bacon grease.
She felt humbled now, as if her accusations
constituted some unforgivable, despicable sin.
This man had never intended to do her the
slightest harm. He really never knew that
she was coming. And through her stupid
clumsiness his life was now ebbing. The doctor&rsquo;s
long words sounded dreadfully in her
ears: general sepsis, blood poisoning, a system
overwhelmed by the toxines of virulent microbes;
they reverberated in her ears like so
many sentences of death. Was there any hope
that this outflowing life would ever turn in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
its course and return like an incoming tide?
Would she again see him able to lift up his
head, to speak in words no longer dictated by
the vagaries of delirium? She would give
anything to be able to ask his pardon humbly
after his mind cleared again. Oh, it was unthinkable
that he should die, that the end
might be coming soon, and that she must go
forth with that unspeakable load of misery in
her heart.</p>
<p>Maigan restlessly kept on coming to her
and placing his head in her lap, as if seeking
comfort. Once she bent over and put her
cheek against his jaw and furry ear. He was
a companion in misery.</p>
<p>When she lifted up her head again to stare
once more at the sufferer, with eyes heavily
ringed with black, he slowly opened his own
and looked at her vaguely, for at first there
was not the slightest sign of recognition in
them. Presently, however, the girl saw something
that looked like a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&ndash;&ndash;how long have I been asleep?&rdquo;
he asked, weakly. &ldquo;And have&ndash;&ndash;have you
been here all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, conscious that her heart was
now beating with excitement, and  his eyes
closed again. But his hand had sought the
one she had laid on the blanket and rested on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
it, for a few moments. It was the ever-recurring
call of the man for the comfort of a
woman&rsquo;s touch, for the protection his strength
gathers from her weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re ever so good and kind,&rdquo;
he said again, in a low hoarse voice, after
which he kept still again, for the longest time.</p>
<p>In spite of the gray pall of clouds over the
sky and the complaining of the gale-swept
tops of the great trees, in spite of the vast dull
roar of the great falls, that had seemed a
dirge, a ray of cheer had entered the little
shack. It had seemed to her like such a paltry
and mean excuse for a dwelling, when she
had first seen it, and had been so thoroughly
in keeping with the sordid nature she had at
once attributed to this man whom she believed
to have brought her there with amazing lies.
But now, in some way, it had become a link,
and the only one, that still attached her a
little to the world. It appeared to her like the
one place where she had been able to obtain a
little rest from her miserable thoughts. Indeed,
it had now become infinitely desirable.
If the man could have stood up again and
greeted her it would have become a haven of
unspeakable comfort, since she would realize
that for once her efforts had not been in vain,
and that she had helped bring him back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
life. But of course she knew that she must
leave it soon, that whether he died or recovered,
the only trail she could follow would
be one that would lead to the banks of the
Roaring River, where the big air holes were.
And yet, so strongly is hope implanted in the
human heart, this termination of her adventure
seemed to have receded into a dimmer
future, like the knowledge which we have that
some day all must die but which we consider
pertains only to some vague and distant period
that we shall not reach for a long time.</p>
<p>Hugo was sleeping quietly now and the
girl&rsquo;s hand upon his pulse detected a feeble
and swift flowing of the blood-current which,
in spite of its weakness, was an improvement.
But the great thing was that another day had
come and he was still living, and his breathing
came quietly. If&ndash;&ndash;if she had loved the man,
she never would have been able to go through
all this without a breaking down of her little
strength. As Stefan had said, and as Mrs.
Papineau had also intimated, it was fortunate
for her that she did not love him. Indeed, it
was ever so much better. She was glad indeed
that he had recognized and praised her,
and then his voice had never expressed the
slightest sign of reproach. She was happy
that he had found comfort in her presence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
beside his couch and&ndash;&ndash;and had been able to
smile at her.</p>
<p>Madge opened the door to let Maigan out.
The air was full of feathery masses of snow
blown from treetops. Sheltered as she was
from the wind, the cold was no longer so penetrating.
In the east the gray was tinted
through the agency of long rifts in which dull
shades of red broke through and were reflected
even upon the white at her feet. It was not a
cheery world just then, since the sun did not
shine and the great fronds of evergreens
loomed very dark, but the vastness of the
wooded valley sloping down beneath her and
stretching beyond the limits of her vision impressed
her with a sense of greatness and of
power. It was a tremendously big, strong
and inexorable world, in which was being
fought the unending and apparently unjust
battle of the mighty against the weak, of the
wolves and lynxes against the deer and hares,
of a myriad furred and sharp-fanged things
against the feebler and defenseless things of
the forest. But also it was a world capable of
bringing forth majestic things; able and willing
to reward toil; in which, despite all of
nature&rsquo;s unceasing cruelty, there could reign
happiness and the accomplishment of a heart&rsquo;s
desire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>All this was not clearly shaped in Madge&rsquo;s
mind. She was merely undergoing a vague
and potent influence that penetrated her very
soul. She closed the door again very softly,
and when she sat again it was with a strange
feeling of contentment, or at any rate a surcease
of bitter thoughts, which affected her
gently, like the heat of the little stove.</p>
<p>Maigan soon scratched at the door again,
and through the frosted glass Madge saw
Mrs. Papineau approaching. She was looking
rather tired and dismal. It was evident,
from her panting, that she had hurried, but
now she was coming very slowly, as if afraid
to hear bad news. But when she finally came
in and looked at Hugo, her fat face took on
some of its wonted cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heem no look so bad now,&rdquo; she asserted.
&ldquo;Who know? Mebbe get all right again,
eh? What Docteur Starr heem say before
he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge was compelled to give her a long
account of how the night had passed and to
describe every move and relate every word of
the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; approved Mrs. Papineau.
&ldquo;Now you go to our &rsquo;ouse an&rsquo; get to bed an&rsquo;
&rsquo;ave sleep. If de children make noise tell &rsquo;em
I slap &rsquo;em plenty ven I get back, sure. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
need bad for to sleep&ndash;&ndash;h&rsquo;eyes look tired an&rsquo;
red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She explained that Papineau had been
obliged to go off after some traps that were
not very far away, and would return by midday.
She insisted upon the need of Madge to
impress the children with the virtues of
silence. They had already been informed
that if they did not keep still when the lady
returned they would be given to the <i>loup-garou</i>
and other mythical and traditional terrors
of <i>habitant</i> childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me stay &rsquo;ere all day. Den you come back
an&rsquo; stay de night, if you lak&rsquo;. You tell me
vat I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good lady found her endeavors useless,
however. Hadn&rsquo;t the doctor said that
incessant care might perhaps, with luck, bring
about a recovery? And Hugo had been better&ndash;&ndash;he
had spoken&ndash;&ndash;he might speak again
and want something she might get him.
Moreover, the dressing was to be changed very
soon and the drainage tubes were to be flushed
out once in so often with the solution the doctor
had left. To have gone away then would
have been desertion; she never entertained the
thought for an instant.</p>
<p>Hence she attended to these things, in the
presence of Mrs. Papineau, who looked quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
awed at the proceedings. Generally the man
seemed quite unconscious of what she did, and
there was little complaint from him; just a
few moans and perhaps a slight drawing away
when she hurt him slightly in spite of her
gentle handling. Finally Madge consented
to rest a little, providing she was not forced
to leave the shack. In the absence of other
accommodation Mrs. Papineau had spread a
heavy blanket on the floor, with odds and
ends of spare clothing. It was only after
the good woman had solemnly promised to
awaken her in case there was the slightest need
that the girl at last lay down, feeling dead
tired but without the slightest desire to sleep,
as she thought. But it did not take a very long
time before her eyes closed and she was deep
in slumber that was heavy and dreamless.
Maigan came and curled up beside her. He
thoroughly approved of her.</p>
<p>It was only after midday that she awoke,
startled, as if conscious of having been remiss
in her duty, and raised herself quickly to a
sitting posture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&ndash;&ndash;is everything all right?&rdquo; she asked,
anxiously.</p>
<p>Upon being reassured she tried to lie down
again, at Mrs. Papineau&rsquo;s urging, but sleep
refused to come. Indeed, she felt greatly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
rested. And then she began to feel very
hungry and had a meal of bread and tea, with
a few dried prunes. It was not a very fine
repast, but Madge was amazed to see what a
lot she could eat. When she rose from the
table she felt conscious that in some way she
had gained strength, in spite of her weariness.
After this she renewed the dressings again,
taking the greatest pains with them. It was
getting dark when Mrs. Papineau left her,
utterly indifferent to the howling of wolves
on the distant ridges. She had offered to remain
but Madge knew that her presence was
needed at home, owing to the little ones.
Moreover, the girl was getting accustomed to
her weird surroundings.</p>
<p>In the faithful Maigan there was a protector.
Besides, she still counted among the
living; she was engaged in work that called
for and brought out all her womanhood. In
spite of her fears for the man the longing for
his recovery was becoming mingled with a
vague confidence, with the idea of a possibility
that something might happen that would
gradually develop in some sort of promise for
a future that would not be all sorrow and
toil. It was perhaps simply a temporary forgetfulness
of self when confronted with what
was a greater and stronger interest. The girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Madge had become less important when compared
to the dying man. She was merely an
instrument wherewith destiny helped to shape
certain indefinite ends. Her own turn had
not yet come, and her personality was submerged
in a simple acquiescence in plans and
decrees she could not understand.</p>
<p>It appeared that the dreariness of the long
hours had lessened. The imminent threat of
the day before was no longer so vivid and
racking, for the man kept on breathing with
fair ease, and his pulse was perhaps a little
stronger. She was wondering why Stefan had
not returned as he had promised, when the now
familiar sound of dogs and sled fell again on
her ears. To her joy and surprise she found
that it was the doctor, returning with the
Swede.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Managed to get away after all,&rdquo; explained
the former. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s own thing to
think there&rsquo;s a chap somewhere that a fellow
might perhaps help, and then be obliged to
let him go because others are calling for you.
Women are desperately fond of asking their
husbands if they would save them or their
mothers first, in case of need. It&rsquo;s the deuce
and all of a question to answer. But we fellows
who practice on the edge of the wilderness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
are all the time confronted by beastly
questions of that sort. How is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think he&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; she hastened
to inform him, and described how the sick
man had spoken and been quite lucid for some
moments. Dr. Starr went in and stopped at
the side of the bunk, looking down with his
chin resting on his hand.</p>
<p>To Madge he had seemed to be a man of
few words, rather stern in his manner and
apt, as she thought, to view humanity from a
very materialistic point of view. His recent
speech was the longest she had heard from
him. In a somewhat cynical vein he had referred
to some hard problems the lone practitioner
has to solve at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, he seems to be holding his
own,&rdquo; he finally admitted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that
he is a bit worse. It seems to me that you&rsquo;re
a pretty capable nurse. Some brains and lots
of good strong will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked away from her as he talked and
began to rub his hands together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he said, turning again
to her. &ldquo;This night might be the decisive
one, and I think I&rsquo;ll stick it out here again.
I&rsquo;ll catch the freight back in the morning, as
I did to-day. We&rsquo;ll have a look at the wound
now, and see how those drains are working.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Did you follow my orders? But I think I
needn&rsquo;t ask. Put more water on the stove,
Stefan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge had been holding the lamp for him,
and when the doctor passed his hand over
Hugo&rsquo;s forehead the eyes opened and the man
blinked. Also there seemed to be a relaxing
of the tense, hollow-cheeked face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s saving my life,&rdquo; he whispered,
hoarsely. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s tireless and&ndash;&ndash;and
kindness itself. Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t let her get
played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put out a brown hand that had rapidly
become very thin and touched the girl&rsquo;s arm,
after which he lay back, exhausted by his
slight effort. The doctor went to work again,
baring the wound, injecting fluids, adjusting
the drains, and as he busied himself he always
found the girl at his side, with all that he
needed ready at his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for a while,&rdquo; he finally said.
&ldquo;The drainage is good. He isn&rsquo;t absorbing
much poison now, that&rsquo;s sure. If we can keep
up his strength he&rsquo;s going to pull through, I
hope. Get us a bite of supper, Stefan, I&rsquo;m
as hungry as a bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the night the doctor dozed off
again, at times, like a man well versed in conserving
his energy. But whenever he awoke
he found Madge wide awake, intently observing
the patient or busy with something for his
comfort. The sky had cleared again and the
great trunks were again cracking in the frost
of the bright and starlit night. Dr. Starr had
been staring for some moments at the girl.
He shivered a little and drew his stool nearer
the stove. Stefan was again snoring on the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here,&rdquo; he told Madge in a low
voice, &ldquo;bring your seat with you. I want to
get something off my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t answer if you don&rsquo;t wish to,&rdquo;
he told her, &ldquo;but&ndash;&ndash;but there&rsquo;s something
rather tragic about that little face of yours.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s idle curiosity, but I&rsquo;d like
to know. I might as well confess that I&rsquo;ve
been questioning that fellow Stefan about you,
but the sum of his knowledge is best represented
by zero. I can assure you that I don&rsquo;t
want to intrude and that I won&rsquo;t be a bit
offended if you tell me it&rsquo;s none of my
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo; asked
Madge, rather frightened, although she did
not know why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are aware, of course, that we doctors
are used to seeing pain and usually try to get at
the cause, so that we may better know how to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
relieve it. I should judge that you have
known a lot of suffering; that sort of thing
leaves marks. Fortunately, they can often be
effaced in the young. I have been thinking
that you were in need of a friend. No! Don&rsquo;t
draw back! I&rsquo;ll say right now that my wife &rsquo;s
the best woman on earth and I&rsquo;ve got four
kids. You ought to see the little rascals. Now
I might as well tell you that I&rsquo;m grateful to
you for taking such good care of my patient.
I&rsquo;d also be glad of a chance to help you a
little, or give advice if you happen to need
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge stared at him for a moment during
which her eyes became somewhat blurred.
The doctor&rsquo;s offer seemed like the first really
disinterested and friendly one that had been
proffered to her for some years. In that vast
New York she had become unused to that
sort of thing. The other people in this place
had been ever so kind, of course, but it was
on account of their friend Hugo. At first she
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a man that can be trusted,&rdquo;
she said, very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that I am,&rdquo; he answered, simply.</p>
<p>Then, gradually, moved by that desire to
confess and trust in a friend that is one of the
best qualities of human nature, she told of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
her coming, in halting, interrupted words.
The doctor kept silent, nodding now and then
so that she became impressed with a certainty
that he understood. At times that deep red
color suffused her cheeks, but they would
soon become pale again, all the more so for
her dark-ringed eyes. Little by little her
story became easier to tell. She had sketched
it out in a few broad lines, but the man to
whom she spoke happened to know the world.
Her speaking relieved her burdened heart
and gave her greater strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and I think that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she faltered
at last. &ldquo;Do&ndash;&ndash;do you really understand?
Do you think I&rsquo;ve been a shameless
creature to venture into this? Can you realize
what it is to be at the very end of one&rsquo;s tether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor looked at her, the tiny wrinkles
in the corners of his eyes becoming more
pronounced. He put out his long-fingered,
capable hand to her, and she stretched out her
own, timidly, in response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I, from this time on, are a pair
of friends,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m
acquainted with that huge beehive you came
from, with its drones and its workers, its
squanderers and its makers. I studied there
for a couple of years, and I know why some
of the women have a choice between the river
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
and even fouler waters. But let me tell you
what I think of this matter. The desperate
effort you made to save yourself may not have
been very good judgment. Ninety-nine times
out of a hundred such an endeavor would be
worse than jumping from the frying-pan into
the fire. But at least it argues something
strong and genuine in you. You came because
you felt that you could not give up the
fight without one last supreme trial. Such a
thing would take a lot of pluck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment, looking into the
whites of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve made up your mind that
all your struggle has been in vain and that the
end is in sight. Now I can&rsquo;t tell where that
end lies, Miss Nelson, but it looks to me as if
it had retired into the far distance. You are
going to keep on taking care of this man, of
course. He needs you badly, in the first place,
and the toil and stress of it will be good for
your soul. And then saving a life is tremendously
interesting. There&rsquo;s nothing like it.
But your new life is only to begin when this
job is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the girl,
watching him eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re through with this case,
Stefan will bring you back to Carcajou.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
There he&rsquo;ll put you on the train and send
you to me. I can assure you that my wife will
welcome you. She&rsquo;s that sort, strong and
friendly and helpful. My poor little chaps
don&rsquo;t see very much of their daddy, but
they&rsquo;ve got a mother who&rsquo;s a wonder, to
make up for it. Now our village can&rsquo;t yet
afford a trained nurse, though some day I&rsquo;m
going to have a little hospital and two or
three of them. The railroad will help. But
in the meanwhile you&rsquo;re going to work for
me, at little more than a servant&rsquo;s wages.
You&rsquo;re quick and intelligent and have a pair
of gentle and capable hands. There are scores
and scores of little houses and shacks where
your presence would be simply invaluable.
My wife tries it, but she can&rsquo;t do it all, with
the kids and the husband to look after. I shall
work you like a horse, when you get strong
enough, but every bit of the work will help
some poor devil. My wife can give you a
bed, a seat at our table and plenty of good
wise friendship. In all this you&rsquo;re going to
give away a lot more than you will receive.
How does it strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Madge was weeping silently, with her
face held in her hands. The doctor had certainly
not tried to make his proposition very
attractive, and yet she felt as if she were emerging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
from deep waters in which she had been
suffocating. Now there was pure air to
breathe and there would always be God&rsquo;s sunlight
to cheer one and bring blessed warmth.
From the slough of despond she was being
drawn into the glory of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall try,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;Oh, how
hard I&rsquo;m going to try! It&ndash;&ndash;it seems just
like some wonderful dream. But&ndash;&ndash;but can
I really earn all this&ndash;&ndash;are you sure that it
isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charity on my part?&rdquo; interrupted the
doctor. &ldquo;Not a bit, Miss Nelson. We&rsquo;re
scantily provided with women in these new
countries. And there are enough poor fellows
who get hurt in the mines, or on the
railroad, to give you plenty of employment
without counting the regular settlers. A good
woman&rsquo;s face at their side may make the end
easier for some of them and help others get
well quicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&ndash;&ndash;if you are very sure&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. You
see, Miss Nelson, there is really no need of
any one despairing in one of those big cities,
so long as there is enough strength and courage
left to get out of them. In this great
expanse of wilderness toilers are needed, but we
can&rsquo;t use mollycoddles. The men have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
hew and dig and plow, and need women to
work at their sides, to look after the injured,
to teach the little ones, to keep the rough
crowd civilized and human. More than all
they are needed to become the mothers of a
strong breed engaged in the conquest of a
new world, one that is being made first with
the axe and the hoe and in which the victory
represents germinating seed and happy usefulness.
Countries such as this are not suited
to the dross of humanity. We cannot find
employment for the weak, the lazy, or the
shiftless. The first of these are to be pitied,
of course, but we cannot help them. To the
red-blooded and the clean of heart it offers
all that sturdy manhood and womanhood can
desire. Surely you can see how wide our
horizons are, how full of promise is this new
world that stretches out its welcoming arms
to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&ndash;&ndash;I see it all,&rdquo; answered the girl.
&ldquo;Oh, what a glorious vision it is! How can I
ever thank you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; replied the man,
sharply. &ldquo;If you decide to accept my offer I
will be the one to feel grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her keenly, and was doubtless
satisfied with what he saw. Then he tilted
back the legs of his stool, rested his head on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
the log wall behind him, and took another
good sound nap.</p>
<p>He went away again just before sunrise,
and Madge was left once more alone with
the sick man. Soon she noticed that his eyes
opened frequently, and followed her when
she happened to move about the room. She
could see that her presence strengthened him.
In Hugo&rsquo;s mind, however, there was the dim
impression that he was returning from a long
blindfolded journey that had left no impressions
of anything but vague pain and deep
weariness. And it was utterly wonderful to
be greeted by a gentle voice and given care
such as had not been his since childhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>The Hoisting</span></h3>
</div>
<p>On the few rests the dogs were compelled
to take on their way back to Carcajou,
Dr. Starr again questioned Stefan, carefully.
The story Madge had told him was interesting,
it sounded a little like some of those tales
of detectives and plots marvelously unraveled,
but the trouble was that no sleuth was at work
and the mystery was as deep as ever. He inquired
carefully in regard to the enemies
Hugo might have made, but struck an absolute
blank. Yes, there was one fellow Hugo
had licked, but a couple of weeks later the
young man had obliged him with a small
loan, which had been cheerfully repaid, and
the individual in question had moved a couple
of hundred miles east. Oh, that was way
back last summer!</p>
<p>Having thus easily eliminated the masculine
element of Carcajou, it took no great effort
on the doctor&rsquo;s part to turn to the women.
Were there any who had reason to dislike
him; had he made love to any of them?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo make lofe to any gals in Carcajou!&rdquo;
exclaimed Stefan, holding a burning
match in his fingers and letting it go out.
&ldquo;Hugo don&rsquo;t nefer make lofe to nobotty.
Dere&rsquo;s McGurn&rsquo;s gal over to the store as
looked like she vanted bad to make lofe to
him; alvays runnin&rsquo; after Hugo, she vos.
Vhen he go in de post-office she alvays smile
awful sveet at Hugo, and dere&rsquo;s dem as say
she vere pretty mad because he don&rsquo;t never
pay no attention. Vhat he care for de red-headed
t&rsquo;ing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks after all the mail, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, McGurn he too busy vid oder t&rsquo;ings.
De gal tends to all de letters an&rsquo; papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed an indication worth following.
When they reached the depot at Carcajou, Joe
Follansbee informed them that the freight
would be about an hour late. Madge had,
during the course of her story, told the doctor
all about the visit of the Carcajou Vigilantes,
and from Stefan he had obtained the names of
the people who had made up the party. Most
of them were known to him, since he was
frequently called to Carcajou, especially
when the mill was running. From the girl
he had obtained the letters she received from
Hugo, as she had formerly believed. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
matter could not be allowed to rest. He must
investigate things further. Meeting old man
Prouty, whom he had once cured of rheumatism,
he drew him aside. The old man quite
willingly told of his share in the event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only wanted to see that everything
was straight and aboveboard,&rdquo; he told the
doctor. &ldquo;And there wouldn&rsquo;t have been no
fuss there at all if Sophy McGurn hadn&rsquo;t
come out kinder crazy; the way them excitable
women-folks does, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo; asked Dr. Starr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she went an&rsquo; accused that young
&rsquo;ooman over there of havin&rsquo; tried to murder
Hugo. Said somethin&rsquo; about the gal wantin&rsquo;
to get square on him for&ndash;&ndash;for somethin&rsquo; or
other as ain&rsquo;t very clear. But soon as Pat
Kilrea he begins to pin her down to facts she
takes it all back an&rsquo; says she don&rsquo;t really know
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Prouty, I&rsquo;m very much
obliged to you. I&rsquo;ll stroll over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked over to the general store and
post-office where he was greeted by old
McGurn, who at his request produced a box
of cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doc, I can recommend them,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;There was a drummer stopped here
last week who said they smelled just like real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
Havanas. I bought two barrels of crockery
off him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor nodded, admiring the drummer&rsquo;s
diplomacy, and walked over to the other
counter behind which Miss Sophy was
standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss McGurn?&rdquo; he said,
amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do? How&rsquo;s Hugo&ndash;&ndash;Hugo
Ennis?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may perhaps pull through, though
he&rsquo;s still hanging on to a pretty thin chance.
I suppose you know that you&rsquo;re soon going
to be called as a witness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that story about an accident looks
rather fishy to me, you know. I have an idea
that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing to have the
sheriff come over here and investigate things
a little. We&rsquo;re beginning to get too civilized
on this line to stand for gun-play. I&rsquo;ve
talked over the matter with some of the people
who went with you to Roaring River, and I
gather that you are the only one who can
enlighten us a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know anything!&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably too modest, Miss
McGurn, or you may perhaps be trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
shield some one. That shows your kind heart,
of course, but it won&rsquo;t quite do for the law.
At any rate you will tell us what aroused your
suspicions. It&rsquo;s very important, you know,
for the slightest clue may be of service. And
then, of course, there is the matter of the
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What letters?&rdquo; cried the girl, biting her
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just some letters that passed through
this office. Let me see, where did I put them?
Always indispensable to secure all documents.
Miss Nelson gave them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very slowly he pulled the letters out of his
pocket, while his keen eyes searched Sophy&rsquo;s
face, gravely. She was distinctly ill at ease,
he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a queer mix-up. These
documents can hardly be called forgery, since
there is no attempt to imitate the real handwriting
of the person who is supposed to have
written them. It&rsquo;s simply a clumsy attempt
to deceive, as far as I can see. But the strange
thing is that several letters came from New
York, apparently, and have never been received.
It seems that they must have come
through this office and the post-office authorities
will be asked to trace them. They are
always glad to hear of any irregularities, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
course, and will send an expert here, naturally,
if mere inquiry does not suffice. Those
chaps are wonderfully clever, you know.
They seem to be able to find out anything
they want to know. The letters I am showing
you came through Carcajou, there&rsquo;s your
stamp on the envelopes. The detective will
compare this handwriting with that of every
man, woman and child in Carcajou and the
neighborhood, and while it is certainly disguised,
there&rsquo;s so much of it that they will
certainly find out who sent them. It&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
going to prove devilish tough for somebody,
you may be sure. Of course I&rsquo;m no lawyer
and can&rsquo;t tell what the charge will be, perhaps
conspiracy of some sort, or making use of the
mails for some fraudulent or&ndash;&ndash;or some prohibited
purpose. But that&rsquo;s evidently no concern
of ours and I know you&rsquo;ll help the
authorities to the best of your ability. You
will naturally do all you can because no postmaster
likes to have any irregularity in his
office. That sort of thing generally means
taking it away from the holder and putting
it in other hands. Your father would be
pretty angry if anything like that happened,
because while you attend to the mails, he&rsquo;s
really the responsible party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Sophy may not have realized how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
keenly the doctor was looking at her. He was
now feeling quite certain that his suspicions
had fallen on the guilty party. Here was a
jealous woman who evidently knew a good
deal. Putting two and two together is the
very essence of scientific thought and Dr.
Starr was no beginner. Sophy&rsquo;s foot was
beating a rapid tattoo on the floor. On her
face the color kept going and coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has done a very foolish thing,&rdquo;
continued the doctor. &ldquo;Perhaps it was not
realized that it was also a very wicked one.
At any rate there is a lot of trouble coming.
I will bid you good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on his heels, lighting the cigar
he had bought and looking quite unconcerned.
Sophy hastened around the counter and intercepted
him at the door, following him out.
She touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ndash;&ndash;do they suspect any one?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I may have spoken too much,
Miss McGurn,&rdquo; answered the doctor, with a
face that had suddenly become exceedingly
stern. &ldquo;It is not for me to answer your question.
Of course, it&rsquo;s in my power to tell the
sheriff that there is no longer any suspicion
that the shooting was otherwise than accidental,
and I could perhaps also persuade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
Miss Nelson not to follow this matter of the
letters any further. I think that she would
follow my advice in the matter. But I have
no intention of interfering until&ndash;&ndash;until I
know everything&ndash;&ndash;down&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;last&ndash;&ndash;word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accentuated this by striking with his
fist into an open hand, slowly, as if driving in
a rebellious spike. They were alone on the
little veranda of the store. Within her breast
the girl&rsquo;s heart was throbbing with fear&ndash;&ndash;with
the terror of exposure and unknown punishments.
She felt that this man knew the
exact truth and she had the sensation of some
animal cornered and seeing but a single
avenue of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have found out everything I wanted
to know, Miss McGurn,&rdquo; Dr. Starr told her,
suddenly. &ldquo;Unless I have a written confession
in my hands I shall let matters take their
course. It&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;for&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My train should be here in fifteen minutes,&rdquo;
he told her. &ldquo;After that it will be too
late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl broke down. Wild thoughts
had come and gone. If a weapon had been
at hand she might, in obedience to the behest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
of a wild and fiery nature, have stabbed the
man who so calmly faced her. But she felt
utterly helpless and her fear and despair became
supreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll write whatever you want me to,
if&ndash;&ndash;if you promise not to tell!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite prepared to accept conditions,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;I intend to show the
paper to Ennis and to Miss Nelson. They
have a right to know the truth. But I can
promise that they will carry the matter no
farther, and that I shall see that neither the
sheriff nor the post-office authorities will interfere.
There are but a few minutes left
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rushed into the store again and went
to the desk. Her father was no longer in the
room. With feverish speed she wrote while
the doctor bent over her, suggesting a word
now and then. Finally she signed the paper
and handed it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better give me those
answers now,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Those directed
to A. B. C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Box 17 she took the letters and
handed them over without a word, and the
doctor carefully placed them in his pocket
with the others.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve been very wise in taking
my advice, Miss McGurn,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;It
was the only way out of trouble. Isn&rsquo;t that
the freight&rsquo;s whistle? I&rsquo;ll hurry off. Good-day
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped quickly across the space that
separated him from the station. On the platform
Joe Follansbee greeted him pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine clear day, doctor,&rdquo; said the station
agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything is beautifully clear now,&rdquo;
answered Dr. Starr amiably. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if this were about the last of the cold
weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he got on the caboose, where the crew
welcomed him. As one of the company doctors
he had the right to ride on anything that
came along, and the men were always glad to
see him. They made him comfortable in a
corner and offered him hot tea and large
soggy buns. But he thanked them, smilingly,
and sat down in a corner. From his bag he
took out a medical journal and was soon immersed
in an exceedingly interesting article
on hysteria.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at that very moment
Miss Sophy had run up to her room and
thrown herself on the bed, face downwards
and buried in a pillow. She was weeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
and uttering incoherent cries. When her
mother came in, alarmed, the old lady was
indignantly ordered out again while the girl&rsquo;s
feet beat against the mattress hurriedly, and
she bit the knuckles of her hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>The Peace of Roaring River</span></h3>
</div>
<p>It is particularly in the great north countries
that the season changes from the lion into
the lamb, with a swiftness that is perfectly
bewildering. The sick man was getting well.
Over a week since, Dr. Starr had declared that
all danger had passed. And as the days went
by the cold that had shackled the land disappeared
so that the frosted limbs by the great
falls wept off their coating of gems, and the
earth, in great patches, began to show new
verdure. Then had come twenty-four hours
of a pelting, crashing rain, that had melted
away more snow and ice. After the rain was
over and the sky had cleared again, Madge
had gone out and stood by the brink of the
great falls, where she watched the thundering
turbid flood as it madly rushed into the great
pit below. Incessantly great cakes of ice
poised on the brown-white edge above for an
instant, and hurled themselves furiously into
the chasm as if bent on everlasting devastation.
The river itself was rising swiftly and from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
time to time the great logs that had remained
stranded in the upper reaches of the river also
plunged into the vortex, where they twisted
and sank and rose, endlessly.</p>
<p>There was something fascinating in this
vast turmoil of mighty forces, in this leaping
forth of a great river now liberated and escaping
towards the great lakes and thence to
the ocean. Hitherto Madge had gazed upon
them timidly, with sudden shivers, as if all
this had represented part of the great peril of
life and actually threatened her. But now it
seemed to have become a part of the immensity
of this world, a fragment of the wondrous
heritage of nations still to be born. And
just as the flood still had a long journey to
travel ere it found rest in the Atlantic&rsquo;s bosom,
so now Madge felt that her own course represented
but the beginning of a new and greater
life.</p>
<p>In spite of many nights spent at that bedside,
she looked far better and more robust
than when she had first reached Roaring
River. Courage had returned to her and
with it the will to endure, to live, to seize upon
her share of the wondrous glory of this new
world that was so fresh and beautiful. And
yet her thoughts were very sober; she did not
feel that she had reached utter happiness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
Her life would now be one of usefulness, according
to the doctor&rsquo;s promise. She felt that
faces might become cheerier at her coming
and that little children&ndash;&ndash;the children of
other people&ndash;&ndash;would welcome her and crow
out their little joy.</p>
<p>Several long nights of quiet rest had built
her up into a woman that was no longer the
factory drudge or the recent inmate of hospitals.
One of the Papineau children had
come over to remain with Hugo, lest he
should need anything. Madge attended him
during the day, concocting things on the stove,
dressing the fast closing wound and administering
the drugs left by the doctor, with the
greatest punctuality, and the man&rsquo;s eyes followed
her every motion, generally in silence.
She also spoke little. It was as if, upon both
of them, a timidity had come that made it
hard for them to exchange thoughts. The
first time he had wanted to speak of the problem
of her coming she failed to encourage
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all that happened now,&rdquo; she told
him, &ldquo;and I have long known that you were
not at fault, in any way. Indeed, I feel grateful
for your forbearance when I first came.
But, if you don&rsquo;t mind, we won&rsquo;t speak of it
again. It&ndash;&ndash;it distresses me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>He saw plainly that she had blushed, in
spite of the fact that she turned her head
swiftly away, and remained silent until she
came again with a teaspoonful of something
he must swallow.</p>
<p>So she sat down again and her mind reverted
to the future, which was certainly immeasurably
splendid and promising, as compared
to the outlook of a fortnight before.
In her pockets were the letters she had written
to this man. Dr. Starr had brought them to
her one day, when Hugo was already able to
listen and understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they were intended for me,&rdquo; said
the latter, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Madge, reddening and
leaping from her stool. &ldquo;Please give them
to me, Dr. Starr. They were sent to an utterly
unknown man. They were replies to
letters you never sent and therefore they&rsquo;re
not yours. Please&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d rather you
didn&rsquo;t see them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man had nodded, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re yours,&rdquo; he acknowledged.
&ldquo;We&ndash;&ndash;we won&rsquo;t mention them
again, if it&rsquo;s your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed&ndash;&ndash;indeed it is. They were just a
cry for help&ndash;&ndash;for a chance to live&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
for a little happiness. Dr. Starr has now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
offered me all these things and I have accepted&ndash;&ndash;ever
so gratefully. I&ndash;&ndash;I had taken
a step that was utter folly, yes, absolute madness.
But now the most wonderful good fortune
has brought me the fulfilment of these
desires and I want to forget all the rest&ndash;&ndash;the
burning shame I have felt as well as the terror
with which I approached whatever was in
store for me. That part of it will pass away
like some bad dream, I hope. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
kind of you not to insist on seeing these
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Miss Nelson,&rdquo; said the
doctor, soothingly. &ldquo;Hugo, my lad, you owe
a good deal to your nurse and I&rsquo;m glad that
you&rsquo;re properly grateful and not unduly
curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hugo called Maigan to him, without
answering, and patted the animal&rsquo;s head, after
which he remarked that the days were getting
much longer.</p>
<p>Came another day when the patient was
able to get up, with the aid of Stefan and his
nurse, and manifested the usual surprise of
the strong man after illness. It was astonishing
that his legs were so weak, and he couldn&rsquo;t
understand the dizzy sensations in his head.</p>
<p>After a time he became able to use his arm
a little, very cautiously, and his joy was great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
when it served him to handle a fork, for the
first time since he had been ill.</p>
<p>And so now she was standing beside these
great falls, thinking very deeply. She was
disappointed at herself because she did not
feel properly happy and grateful; indeed, she
was dropping in her own estimation. If any
one, a month before, had placed before her the
prospect of honest toil among friendly faces,
of usefulness that would benefit her while
gaining gratitude from others, she would have
deemed herself the happiest woman in the
world. Yes, the world should have been a
very beautiful and kindly place, now that
hunger and pain were eliminated, now that
the coming of spring would cause sap to surge
up the trees so that the branches would soon
clothe themselves in the tender glory of new
leafage. Her own existence was on the verge
of a fresh new growth that might lead to
greater things, and yet she reproached herself
because she could not become conscious of a
real happiness, of a glorious achievement that
had been like an unexpected manna coming
to starvelings in a desert. She felt nothing
but a quiet acquiescence in the new conditions
and accepted her new destiny with a sigh.</p>
<p>She did not realize yet that in her soul a
new longing had come, that would not be
denied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>She returned slowly to the shack where
Hugo sat in an armchair brought all the way
from Carcajou on Stefan&rsquo;s sled. His arm was
still in a sling. It was fortunate that it was
the left one, for he was very busily engaged in
writing.</p>
<p>The girl waited for some time, leaning
against the doorpost and watching some
chipping sparrows that had recently arrived
and were thinking hard about nest-building
in the neighboring bushes.</p>
<p>The weeds and grasses and wild flowers
were beginning to peep out of the ground,
with the haste that is peculiar to northern
lands where life is strenuous during the few
months of warm fair weather. The tender
hues of the burgeoning birches and poplars,
streaked with the gleaming silver of their
trunks, were casting soft notes upon the strong
greens of the conifers and the indigo of their
shadows. In the spray of the falls, to her
left, a tiny rainbow seemed to dance, and the
loud song of the rushing waters was like the
call of some great loving voice. She reflected
that she would have to go again to a place in
which many people lived. It would not be
like a city. The same trees and the same
waters and the same flowers would be there,
very close at hand. Not a single house abutted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
against another. In the gardens there would
be old-fashioned flowers such as she had been
familiar with at home, before she had sought
the town. Dr. Starr had described it all.
Ten minutes&rsquo; walk would take one beyond the
habitations of men, into woodlands and fields
and by a lake that extended into a far wilderness,
upon which one could drive a canoe and
feel as if one owned a great and beautiful
world, for men were seldom on it and above
the surface it was peopled chiefly by great diving
birds and broods of ducklings. It all
sounded, and doubtless was, perfectly ideal.</p>
<p>But presently Hugo had finished his writing
and was leaning back in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you would like some of
those nice fresh eggs Mrs. Papineau&rsquo;s little
girl brought this morning?&rdquo; she asked him.
&ldquo;And would you like me to close the door
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Miss Nelson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I should enjoy them ever so much.
They&rsquo;re a rather scarce commodity with us.
Too many weasels and skunks and other
chicken-eaters to make it a healthy country
for hens. As to the door I&rsquo;ll be glad to have
you close it if you feel cold. But it&rsquo;s delightful
for me to be sitting here all wrapped up
in blankets and taking in big lungfuls of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
forest air. It&ndash;&ndash;it makes a fellow feel like a
two-year-old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to break the eggs into a pan
when she noticed the letter lying on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to get you an envelope,
for it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be so kind,&rdquo; he assented, gravely.</p>
<p>She would have offered to put the paper in
the envelope for him also, but he managed it
easily enough and closed the flap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder what
will come of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this she could not reply, so she prepared
the eggs and brought them to him, with his
tea and toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to be ever so good,&rdquo; he
said, taking up a fork, after which he stared
out of the still-opened door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t eat them now, they&rsquo;ll be cold
in a minute,&rdquo; she warned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d forgotten! I must beg your pardon
since you took so much trouble about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ate them slowly, as if performing some
hard and solemn task. When he had finished
his meal, Madge cleared the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything else you would like?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;One of your books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t think I want to read, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
now. I&ndash;&ndash;I am feeling rather&ndash;&ndash;rather disturbed
for the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she inquired, solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this&ndash;&ndash;this habit I&rsquo;ve gotten into,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;of having a&ndash;&ndash;a nurse at my side.
It seems very strange that she will soon be
gone. I&rsquo;ve learnt to depend so much on....
And Stefan is coming to take you away to
Carcajou&ndash;&ndash;and then over there to Dr. Starr&rsquo;s.
Then I believe I&rsquo;m to go and stay with the
Papineaus, till I can handle a frying-pan and
an axe. The&ndash;&ndash;the prospect is a dismal one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a little step towards him but he
had bent over the letter and was directing it.
When this was done he stared at it for a
moment and, unsteadily, handed it to the girl,
with the writing down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I would like you to deliver this for
me,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;It is ever so important
and&ndash;&ndash;and our post-office isn&rsquo;t very reliable,
I&rsquo;m afraid. But I know I can trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him in surprise and then she
looked at the envelope. To her intense
amazement she read:</p>
<p class='center'>Miss Madge Nelson,<br />
<br />
Roaring River.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; she asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid you will have to read it
to find out,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She opened the door and rushed out. One
fear was in her heart. She dreaded to find
money in it. How dared he offer to pay for
what she had done? She would lay the envelope
on the table, with its contents, and
quietly say&ndash;&ndash;well, what could she say?</p>
<p>With the thing in her hand she walked
down the path to the edge of the falls, where
she sat down on an old big trunk of birch
fallen many years ago and partly covered with
moss. For one or two long minutes she held
it in her lap, gazing at the rushing waters
without seeing them. A strange fluttering was
at her heart, a curious trepidation that was
akin to intense fear caused her neck to throb,
but her face was very pale. Finally, with a
swift gesture, she tore the envelope open and
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>My Good  Little  Nurse:</span></p>
<p>Those other letters were not from me but this
one is: you saw me write it. It carries a thousand
thanks for your kindness and devotion to
your helpless patient. During those dreadfully
long hours your presence was a blessing; it could
soothe away the pain and bring hope and comfort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
In a couple of weeks more I shall be as strong as
ever, but I know that without you Roaring River
will never be the same. You came here bravely,
ready to marry a decent man who would help you
bear the burdens of this world, which had proved
too heavy for you. Of course the man must be
honest and worthy of your trust. After all that
you underwent from the first moment of your being
left alone on the tote-road I cannot wonder at
your desire to go away. But I feel that without
you I could never have pulled through and that
by this time the prospect of a life spent without
you is unbearable.</p>
<p>I am not begging you humbly for your love. I
don&rsquo;t want to owe it to your pity for the man who
was so ill, to the deep charity and the kindness
of a sweet and unselfish nature. That is why I
couldn&rsquo;t speak out my longing for you and the
love that fills my heart, lest I might surprise you
into a hasty consent. I could not have restrained
my emotion and I know I would have begged and
implored&ndash;&ndash;and that might have made it very
hard and painful for you to refuse.</p>
<p>Please return to me after you have read and
thought this over. If we are to remain but friends
you will extend one hand to me and I shall know
what it means. I daresay I shall survive that hurt
as I survived the other. Have no fear for me.</p>
<p>But if you feel in your heart that you can give
me all I long for, that you are willing to become
my wife, then stretch both of those little hands to
me, since it will take the two to carry such a
precious gift.</p>
<p class='ralign'>Your hopeful and grateful patient,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Hugo.</span><span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>After she had finished she tried to read the
paper again, but it was too hard to see. For
a moment she stared at the Roaring Falls
through the misty veil of their spray. Thrusting
the letter into her bosom she found her
feet, suddenly, and ran to the little shack.
Hugo had risen and was standing in the doorway,
his heart beating fast and his face very
pale. As Madge came near she uplifted both
hands, but she could hardly see him. Once
more her eyes were suffused with tears, but it
was as if the glory of a wondrous sunlit world
had been too strong for them. She was smiling
happily, however, when he took both little
hands into his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I hurried back,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Neither&ndash;&ndash;neither
did I feel that&ndash;&ndash;that I could live
without you&ndash;&ndash;without this wonderful peace
of beautiful Roaring River, and&ndash;&ndash;and the
love that it has brought to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later they heard Big
Stefan&rsquo;s familiar shout from the tote-road.
The toboggan could no longer be used and
he had driven over a shaggy old horse that
had pulled a reliable buckboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s yoost great!&rdquo; he roared, as he saw
Hugo standing outside the shack. &ldquo;I tank
I&rsquo;m more pleased as if I find a dozen goldmines,
you bet! De leetle leddy she safe you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
all right&ndash;&ndash;all right. But now I take her avay
to Meester Doctor Starr, like he telt me to.
De doctor he gif me a bit letter for you,
ma&rsquo;am. I find it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two letters on a single day was heavy mail
for Roaring River. Madge tore the last one
open and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Dear Miss Nelson:</p>
<p>Stefan has promised to bring you to us to-morrow.
I want you to come, for my wife and
the kiddies are awaiting you. From my latest
study of conditions at Roaring River I have gathered
that you may not stay with us as long as I
had first hoped, but at any rate it will be long
enough to do a little fixing and arranging of feminine
garments. My instinct tells me that your
visit to us will be short since our patient, if you
tarry too long, may come and steal you away. He
will have to come anyway for, just as I&rsquo;m the
nearest doctor to you, so my friend Jamieson is
the nearest parson.</p>
<p class='ralign'>With every best wish,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
Very sincerely yours,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>David Starr.</span><span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madge handed the letter over to Hugo who
quickly looked it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful fellow is Starr,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Stefan took his friend Hugo up in his arms,
in spite of protests on the latter&rsquo;s part that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
wanted to try to walk. The young man was
a light load, indeed, at this time. He was
placed on the seat of the buckboard and, with
Stefan carefully leading the horse and Madge
walking alongside, was taken up to Papineau&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The woodlands were very different now,
thought the girl. When she had arrived the
great land was plunged in slumber under its
mantle of snow. The few birds there were at
the time were voiceless, like the partridges
that only find a peep when fluffy broods follow
them, or some of the larger fowl which
only hoot or shriek. The sound-calls of the
wilderness had been those of struggling
waters, of cracking trees, of snow-masses violently
displaced. But now birds were in full
song everywhere, carrying trifles of stick and
floss and grass wherewith to build their nests.
Formerly there had been the uneasy groans
and sighs of a gigantic restless sleeper. Now
there was the chant of a heart-free nature
engaged again in vigorous toil, in wresting the
recurrent glory of surging life and hope from
the powers of darkness and bitter, benumbing
cold. It was a resurrection!</p>
<p>The mile separating the shack from the
Papineau homestead had been a long and
fatiguing one on the first occasion of Madge&rsquo;s
going to see the wounded man. Now the distance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
was trivial; a few sturdy steps, a few
fillings of one&rsquo;s lungs with the scent of conifers;
and there was the little chimney smoking
and the cow with her little calf, and the
dogs, and the few hens that had survived the
attacks of weasels. Best of all there were her
friends, children and babies and the quiet
Frenchman and the kind-hearted, red-cheeked,
cheery mother whose influence had been paramount
in creating a little paradise in the wilds.</p>
<p>She helped Hugo off the buckboard, jealously,
deeming herself the only one who could
properly handle an invalid, and enthroned
him in the best chair, near the open fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you are h&rsquo;all so velcome as I can&rsquo;t
say,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Nelson is going away with Stefan
in a few minutes,&rdquo; said Hugo, cheerfully.</p>
<p>At this Mrs. Papineau&rsquo;s face fell. She
looked positively unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&rsquo;ow,&rdquo; she said, sniffing, &ldquo;I always
&rsquo;ope she stay &rsquo;ere h&rsquo;all de time now. I&ndash;&ndash;I
never tink she go avay for good. De&ndash;&ndash;de
dogs and de calf and&ndash;&ndash;an&ndash;&ndash;de baby and
chil&rsquo;ren dey all love &rsquo;er. I h&rsquo;awful sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m coming back, Mrs. Papineau,&rdquo;
cried Madge. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t live away
from&ndash;&ndash;from Roaring River now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey two iss ter be marrit!&rdquo; roared Stefan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
&ldquo;Hey! What you tank? I tank so all de
time, you bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this they all crowded around Madge,
and such hand-shakings, and such kisses from
the good woman and the children, and such
joy depicted on all the faces! She thought
that never a bride had received such heartfelt
congratulations and good wishes.</p>
<p>But in a couple of hours the old horse was
quite rested and had finished the small bag of
oats Stefan had brought and eaten plenty of
the sweet-scented hay furnished by Papineau,
and it was time to go. Strangely enough, at
the last moment, the usually crowded house
was deserted excepting by two, who found
themselves in one another&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Madge,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I
will come soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be waiting,&rdquo; answered the girl,
simply.</p>
<p>And so she rode away again, in the old
buckboard that rolled and pitched and heaved
and bucked so that very often she got off and
walked at the side of Stefan.</p>
<p>Late that night she found herself in the
doctor&rsquo;s home, after a wonderful welcome
from his wife and himself. The kiddies had
been put to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I feel that&ndash;&ndash;that I am deserting you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
that you trusted me to help you with a splendid
work,&rdquo; she said, with head bent down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not so,&rdquo; the man answered gravely.
&ldquo;Remember what I told you when I was trying
to enlist you. I say that more than for
any other purposes, we wanted women, good
women, to come and become the mothers of
the strong, fine breed that can alone master
our wilderness. Hugo is one of those fellows
of brawn and brain who are working towards
the common happiness in establishing his own.
He needs a helper he can love and trust and
cherish, one who will in herself be the biggest
reward he can ever gain, and make him feel
that the bigger part of the purpose of his life
has been secured with your promise to marry
him. To me the sick and the halt are paramount&ndash;&ndash;but
they will have to wait a little.
In some way or other they will be looked
after, I promise you, for no man in a responsible
position can be anything but a problem-solver,
in these places, and I&rsquo;ll find someone,
never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours will be the more important occupation
now, my dear,&rdquo; said the doctor&rsquo;s wife;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be in the front ranks of the fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the doctor went away and the two women
made the sewing-machine hum, and cut and
basted and threaded needles. Together they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
managed to put together all that was
indispensable and to discard the frivolous, as
became the wives of pioneers.</p>
<p>Two or three weeks went by very fast and
one day Sophy McGurn, from behind the
shop-window, saw Hugo Ennis standing on
the platform of the little station at Carcajou.
With him was big Stefan, clad in his best, and
the entire Papineau family. Most of the children
were about to take the very first railway
journey of their lives and the excitement was
intense and prolonged. Finally the train came
puffing along and went away again, panting
on the upgrade, while Miss Sophy bit her
nails hard.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Stefan had kept still,
since he had been requested to. No one else
in Carcajou knew anything as to the inwardness
of the girl&rsquo;s coming, of Sophy&rsquo;s share in
it, or of the discovery by the doctor of the
latter&rsquo;s duplicity. And yet there was an element
in Carcajou that frowned upon the
young lady. Her accusation had been
reported far and wide. To the settlers of the
place her suspicions had seemed uncalled-for
and bespeaking a mean and vicious disposition.
Hugo, after all, had been everybody&rsquo;s
friend. He was now about to marry this
young woman from far-away New York.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
This utterly disproved Sophy&rsquo;s statements,
wherefore she became more unpopular than
ever. A couple of hundred men had come
over to work at the sawmill, that was purring
and grinding and shrieking again, all day and
night. In the course of events they were learning
all about the matter, and some of the more
ribald asked her jocular questions. It was
annoying, to say the least, to have a big logger
come in and ask what were the news of the
day, and if there was any more murdering
going on. She projected to leave Carcajou as
soon as she could, and made her parents wish
she would, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The party reached their station and walked
over to the church, that stood in what looked
like a pasture, with great stumps of trees still
dotting the ground. About it was the very
small beginning of a graveyard. With the
years it would grow but always it would be
swept by the winds blowing aromatic scents
from the forests beyond the lake. And about
the church itself grew simple flowers, some
of which were beginning to twine themselves
upon the walls. Madge came up the aisle, attended
by Stefan and the doctor. Hugo met
them, the emotion of the moment having
caused some of the pallor to return to his
cheeks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>It was soon all over. At the doctor&rsquo;s house
there was a little repast, followed by some
simple words that sounded hopeful and strong.
An hour later the couple left, but not for a
honeymoon in the towns. It was in a place
reached after many hours of paddling, where
the red trout abounded and the swallows
darted over the waters. Here in their tent
they could do their own cooking, beginning
the life that was to be one of mutual help, of
cheerful toil, of achievement and of happiness.</p>
<p>When they came back to Carcajou again,
Stefan was waiting for them with a strong
team of horses able easily to negotiate the tote-road.
This highway, in many places, had
been repaired. Fallen trees were cut across
and pulled to one side, swampy bits were
corduroyed, big holes had been filled in. Indeed,
the traffic had become important, all of
a sudden, towards the Roaring Falls. Lumber
had been hauled there, and many tools,
and kegs of nails, and a gang of men had
walked over.</p>
<p>Finally they came in sight of the river
again, in which were no more black-looking,
threatening air-holes. Mostly it was placid
now, with rapids that could easily be passed
over by ably-managed canoes or bateaux, succeeding
the deep still waters now and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
and frothing and fuming only as if in play.
Here a big blue heron rose from it, and there
a couple of kingfishers jabbered and scolded
and shrieked. Partridges crossed the road in
front of the horses, and the inevitable rabbit
scampered away in leisurely fashion.</p>
<p>But they reached the little path that led to
the shack without seeing anything of the tiny
home or of the falls beyond, for the bushes
and shrubs were in full foliage and seemed to
be concealing their Eden from passers-by.
Madge leaped from the wagon. Her kingdom
was over there, just a few rods away, and
she was eager to see it again.</p>
<p>Yes! The shack was still there, looking
tinier than ever. But very close to it a foundation
had been dug from which rose rough
walls of broken stone. Upon these strong
scantlings had been fastened and men were
clapboarding them over into a bigger and
finer home.</p>
<p>Above the trees some smoke was showing.
It marked a place where a half-score shacks
and little barracks were going up, to shelter
the men who were to follow deeper those
promising veins in the great rocks. There
would soon be blasting and more drilling and
the breaking up of ore, which would be carried
down the river to the railroad. But from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
the edge of the great falls nothing of all this
could be seen. Except for the new house
everything seemed to be unchanged. It was
with a sentiment of a little awe, of gratefulness,
of a surprise which the passing of the
weeks had not yet been able to dispel, that
Madge realized that this was now her own,
the place of her future toil, the spot where
she was to found a home and fill it with
happiness.</p>
<p>It was marvelous! It was a thousand times
more splendid than anything she could have
conceived when first she was journeying to this
country. And the greatness of it lay in the
fact that she understood, that she realized, that
she knew that the whole world lay before her
and her husband, to make or mar, to convert
into a part of the great effort that is always a
joy, the upbuilding of a home, or to allow to
revert into the wilderness again if strength
were lacking.</p>
<p>At first she could not step farther than the
little spot from which her dwelling-place first
stood revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, Madge?&rdquo; asked
her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that if I had prayed all my life
for a wonderful home, before coming here, I
would never have been able to pray for anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
so splendid. Think of it&ndash;&ndash;you and I&ndash;&ndash;for
years and years that will pass ever so
swiftly, together in this glorious place and
enjoying perfect peace&ndash;&ndash;the great peace of
Roaring River!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man stood by, his heart very full,
his thoughts following her own, and a wave
of happiness surged into his being, for all that
was best in his former dreams was at his hand,
since nothing but the woman at his side really
counted.</p>
